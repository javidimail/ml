# Personal notes, definitions in machine learning

Types of machine:
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning

-Supervised Learning:
Uses labels to train data
Uses the history of the data to predict
Two types: Classification and Regression
Example: Hight-Weight of Male and Females

Unsupervised learning:
No historical labels
You get the data points but you don't have the labels
Example: Only hight and Weight. no labels at all
So you have to "cluster data"
