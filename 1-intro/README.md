# Personal notes, definitions in machine learning

..*Types of machine:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforced learning

1. Supervised Learning:
...Uses labels to train data
...Uses the history of the data to predict
...Two types: Classification and Regression
....Example: Hight-Weight of Male and Females

2. Unsupervised learning:
...No historical labels
...You get the data points but you don't have the labels
...Example: Only hight and Weight. no labels at all
...So you have to "cluster data"
