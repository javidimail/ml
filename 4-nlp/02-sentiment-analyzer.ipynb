Watching football games in HD, without paying for digital cable, almost made me weep with happiness.\\n\\nThe picture quality for analog channels is only so-so.  I really wish the remote was illuminated.  Also, Amazon took much longer to deliver the TV than was promised.  Other than these negatives, I'm very happy\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nMy new TV finally arrived and I am very pleased with it.  I picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews I could find online, the vast majority of which were very positive (cNet has lots of reviews as well).  Also, I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs, all day every day, and both of them bought this exact set for themselves.\\n\\nMy cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me.  Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite.  My first impression had me rather worried.  I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out.  I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others.  In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them.  I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time.  The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great.  The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen.  The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video.  I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs.\\n\\nThe quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking.\\n\\nSet-up was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual.  Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways, but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon.  Flipping through the on screen menu, I stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since I live at 10,000 ft. above sea level.\\n\\nI was a little disappointed with the delivery situation.  I thought I had ordered the TV in time to have it by opening day kick-off.  Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that.  I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon.  I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away.  But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery.  I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer.  Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place.\\n\\nAll in all, a great set at a great price, I just wish I had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nSo, I was a little weary to buy an iTrip after hearing some mixed reviews. It seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs... or the iTrip worked perfectly. Knowing my luck, it wouldn't work for me at all. I recieved my iTrip and my luck started right away. I tossed the iTrip onto my iPod and..................... nothing. A bad omen? Well, after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing, MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn't find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn't matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned, charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It's not a night-and-day difference, but it's a noticeable improvement. Sure, I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal, but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving, the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weaker-signaled LX mode, not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better, stronger signal. \\nThis product is dependant on several outside factors. The reception your car gets and the availability of a clear FM channel. To rate this product poorly because of factors out of it's control is unfair. There were times when I had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. I love good, crisp sound as much as anyone does... but I'll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. \\n\\nMy recommendation after owning this product for a short time *but it has been used quite a bit already, as I do a lot of driving*, I say: If you can, buy a tape deck adaptor... but if it's not an option and you don't want to put the money into an \"ipod to car\" setup, this is a viable solution indeed. In my opinion, an iTrip is a better option than listening to plain, old radio.\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance. The Disaster Recovery software provided with this drive is it's biggest star. You can format your hard drive, put in the restore disk that you create for your system, and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to EXACTLY the way it was when you created the disk. Or you can simply replace selected files if you want. It does not miss a single thing. Fanstastic. The software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an \"ABC\" book. I would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nThe intuos3 6x11 tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad. The mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks, opening programs is one of them. It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I'm drawing my finger frequently hits it, because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price. I would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet, it is nice to have if you have the desk space. I've heard Wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that I own one I believe it\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI wouldn't be without this. When I first bought the 20d it was my first digital SLR and I spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap. In the end I settled for using both and wouldn't have it any other way. With the battery grip and hand strap in place I find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold. That's all there is to it, that's what it does and it does it well. \\n\\nOn the down side, and it's a small and transient down side, actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you'd sort of expect it to be insecure. I think the trick, security wise, is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first, then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap (if used). I also don't like the attachment to the neck strap, I don't like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use.\\n\\nI use this on a 20d which typically has a 24-200 or 80-400 lens attached. You can only use this if you also use the battery grip, or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location. But since I always use the battery grip I don't have an issue. \\n\\nIf Canon read this, you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price, you normally pay close attention to detail and it's a bit lacking here\\n</review_text>,\n",

I have had success with FujiFilm DVD+R up to 8x.  I`ve also had tremendous success with TDK DVD+R up to 4x and 8x.  Some other brands may not work.  One thing I`ve learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little.  Don`t go recording 3 or 4 -R or +R DVDs every day.  Give it a rest between recordings.  One or two per day is okay.  Definitely give it room to breathe.  If you stack your machines on top of each other, put something in between so they can breathe.  Be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides.  You definitely need to buy a Panasonic DVD player to play back your DVDs - other brand DVD players may not play your recordings properly.\\n\\nOne of the greatest things about this machine is that it records DVD-RAM.  They are re-recordable for many, many times and each program can be erased when watched.  You can even edit the recordings on the DVD-RAM.  Cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program.  Only works on the DVD-RAM.  I have over 50 DVD-RAM discs (Panasonic brand) - they sure take up less space than VCR tapes!\\n\\nGet one or two of these recorders and a Panasonic DVD player and you`ve got it made!

Everything from recording off the TV, to recording movies and shows stored on the DVR, to transferring home movies from the original VHS tapes.  I'm sure for about $300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders, but for under $200, you really can't go wrong.  The only flaw I could find is that the initial hookup (according to the book) didn't seem quite right.  After taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online, everything went smoothly.  Because of that, I'm still going to give it a full 5 stars..it's not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life.

A few annoyances:  The machine responds and loads slowly, but that's not too bad; a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price.

I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FH-E656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out CD player, I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo (made in China).\\n\\nPLUSES: \\ndecent sound\\ngood functionality\\neasy set-up and intuitive operation\\nsimple remote -- but only covers basic functions\\n\\nCONS:\\nvery short speaker leads\\nunattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boombox\\nonly holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic units\\n\\nAt first glance, I was disappointed by the cheap construction, skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies.  But then I thought: in 2006 for $150, I can't expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400.  Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China.  So, for the money, it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom.  The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe, this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty.  I haven't blasted it at full volume, but it seems to have plenty of power when needed.\\n\\nI originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SC-PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn't have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).

The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways?

       " <review_text>\\nFor those of you who bought MiniDisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording, this product is wonderful.  Especially good for recording lectures, voice lessons, etc.  It works quite well with the built-in mono mike, or you could use an external one.\\n\\nOne of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike -- you toggle which setting it is in the settings section.\\n\\nI record my radio shows by plugging in the line-out from the station's tape deck to my iRiver.\\n\\nFor those who recorded live music with their MiniDiscs, it's a little trickier.  You have to set the record input before -- you can't change it on the fly.\\n\\nI've recorded live DJ shows with the built-in and AGC on.  Of course, the booming bass distorts horribly, but overall an easy record of the show.  Very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show.\\n\\nI've also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results.  A bit of trial and error which I'm still refining with later iRiver products.\\n\\nThe single AA batter lasts a good long time.  Summer School involves 2, 2-hour classes, and I can record several days of them before battery is low.  If the battery runs out during recording, fear not, the file is saved!\\n\\nThe negatives are the requirement to go through the special iRiver music program, but there are now firmware updates that will change your iRiver into the typical USB external drag-and-drop drive.\\n\\nFiles are recorded in a .REC file which one then converts to a .mp3 file after transfer to your computer.  I don't know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the .mp3 file.  But you can't trasnfer .mp3 files off your iRiver, even if you made them yourself, so don't think you can use this to transfer .mp3 files from one computer to another.\\n\\nAlso, the molding where the line-in input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some RCA to 1/8\" adaptors, so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way.\\n\\nI've had mine for just over a year now and use it every day, whether just playing mp3s or recording classes.  I'm only just starting to have some trouble with the on/off/play/pause button.  After so many presses, it's starting to wear out.  But it's still working reliably.  I just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention.\\n\\nI have the 1G model (iFP-799) which is great.  I was able to record a 12-hour radio show marathon I produced with it.

I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) \\n\\nThe variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. \\n\\nThe only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.\\n</review_text>,\n",

Also, some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair, so I agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items - but it is possible.  I noticed that I could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the buffing/sanding (pink disc) process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair.  I ran one disc through 3 times in a row, then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine.  My lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great.  I usually clean the disc (manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime), then buff, then repair.  It can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning, but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable.  I think this was good purchase and not overly complicated to use. \\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI'll try to keep this short and sweet.  If you have been frustrated trying to get AM reception on the go, then you've found the right radio for you.  I can't tell you how many pieces of junk I've bought that barely pulled-in even relatively close AM stations unless I constantly twisted the radio to the perfect angle needed to get reception.   Luckily (?) those other radios also died pretty quickly. This Sangean product solves the AM reception problem and seems very durable. I also own their CCRadio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation.  I love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the built-in speaker, just like transistor radios of the 50's and 60's--a seemingly forgotten feature.  As for listening through the supplied earphones, forget it. Sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied.  Never have I heard tinnier sound, even for AM listening.  Not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short.  I immediatey invested another $35 in decent pair of Koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin.  Now I happily and easily listen to AM and FM stations even over the roar of the lawnmower.   There might be alternatives for those of you who plan on listening to FM exclusivey, but if you spend even a little time on the AM dial, I really don't think you have a choice but to pick up this radio\\n</review_text>,\n",

I figured I would \"upgrade\" to this one since my iPod and my car's interior are black. overall the thing performed similarly to my previous one, but with a few little changes.\\n\\nFor one the output of this unit is much lower than its older counterparts. That normally doesn't matter if you choose a good empty frequency, but as you start traveling you notice interference much more than you would expect. \\n\\nNext, I can't turn it up any where near the volume I used to be able to on the older one without getting hissing and static. It seems that the decreased level on the output also increased the amount of electronic noise when using it.\\n\\nLast, the most annoying part of this whole product, is that it turns off the radio transmitter after a period of no use. I have paused my iPod to take a phone call only to have very loud (since the level is so low on it you have to make up for it with stereo volume) static and sometimes radio stations coming through. Very embarrassing. Or when you stop your car and then come back, as soon as the radio turns on you are met with the same very loud noise.\\n\\nSince my car doesn't leave me many options for stereo replacement, this is the best product for my specific situation, though I may try and get that old one back from my friend...maybe an \"upgrade\" to a newer one will settle the deal\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nThe reviews sounded too good to be true.  The reviews are right on.  This system is perfect for home theater.  I have the latest Panasonic plasma.  This receiver is the perfect compliment.  Here is why...\\n\\nI could only start with at 2.1 set up - L/C/R and no sub woofer.  Great digital sound effects with a one button switch to stereo for easy comparison.\\n\\nTons of input/output connectors.  Unless you need HDMI, the available connectors are perfect.  The speaker connectors are screw down/banana plug type for easy, secure connection.  Lots of component video, S-VHS and RCA video inputs.  Lots of analog audio connections AND two digital coax and one optical.  I use the digital coax for my DVD/CD and for my cable box.  \\n\\nReally easy set up.  I could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver.  The manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures.\\n\\nDid I mention the sound.  Frys offers Polk Audio R15 for an indecently low price.  With this receiver the sound is rich - great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels.  Adding a Cerwin Vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all.\\n\\nBest of all, my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before I got home and pronounced it beautiful.  It was the only low profile receiver I could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station.\\n\\nThe end result - I sat down and just watched Hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation.  All for less than the cost of me and the Missus going to the movies for a few weekends.  Get this receiver\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nThis item does exactly what it's suppose to do. It also makes the signal stronger therefore you get better reception. Worth the money. Only drawback would be, there is a lot of cord hanging around\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nThe Sony SS-MF650H are a low-cost solution to good directional sound for a very small room.\\n\\nThough I have not had the opportunity to test the ultra-high (up to 50kHz) frequency, the highs on these speakers sound very well, maybe only slightly boxy - note that the speakers are rather directional so the sound does not spread.\\n\\nThe sound is very flat. The lack of depth makes it feel as if the sound is coming from a flat wall or a small box rather than from a space, especially if you stand further away (over 5 ft.) from the speakers. It seems that the speakers have a much lower than published sensitivity level. However, don't get discouraged because with most speakers/headphones it may be that the speakers need some time to burn in (loosen the diaphragm) to get a bit more \"sustain\" to their output rather than seem to have a very sharp cutoff.\\n\\nThe bass is very punchy, and not deep. I would definitely recommend a subwoofer for these speakers, as their highs are very good, and midranges are nice but maybe a bit flat. The subwoofer will party compensate for the problem, and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect (use the LFE on your receiver for the sub-woofer... don't worry, low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo won't suffer). In other words, you will need a lot of tweaking and additions to make these sound nicer than their out-of-the box quality.\\n\\nIgnore the 50kHz rating for ultra-high-frequency sound as a positive feature, as no receiver you will buy at the budget for these speakers will be rated for that output. Most are rated for 20 Hz - 20kHz, at a reasonable RMS.\\n\\nYou get what you pay for... for the price tag on them, the SSMF650H are good. They perform reasonably well on highs and mids (but in no means studio reference sound), and are crisp and punchy on the bass. They do however seem to lack depth and have low sensitivity - especially so on the bass... the further you move away from them (and especially if you stand up above them), the sound quality suffers.\\n\\nI would recommend Wharfedale Diamond 8.4 speakers as a better choice if you're willing to expand your budget a bit. Polk is also not a bad choice for cheap sound.\\n\\nI also demo-ed the ~$100 per pair CAT SDAT LEB-404 (I think I saw them on overstock for $80 with free shipping). They are a bit shady, but excellent for the price - seems that the 20 Hz bass rating on them is actually somewhat accurate. If you're looking for deep and bass-heavy sound without a sub-woofer, and are willing to take a hit on mids and highs a bit this is your \"budget solution\" instead of the SS-MF650H. I was pleasantly surprised. They also have poor sensitivity though, so if you have a big room shop around for something better.\\n</review_text>,\n",

I've been very impressed with the sound both at the high and low ends - the highs are crisp and the bass is tight, not boomy.

My soundcard is an onboard Soundmax AC97 on an Asus K8V-X motherboard. I set the sound option in Windows XP on \"headphones\" and played \"Metallica- Nothing else matters\" with WinAmp. WOW !!! I was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general. I only use half of the volume available in Windows XP and it`s more than enough for me.\\nI do agree with some other reviews that the bass could be more precise but I found out that it varies a lot depending of the sound source you`re using. The sound is better on  my computer than on my Harman Kardon amplifier and is a lot better on my MP3 player than with the earbuds that came with it.\\nOverall, I would say that these headphones are very good for the inexpensive price. They blow away all the competition in the same price range. Compared to my old Panasonic, it`s a drastic improvement especially for the bass response.\\nWhen it comes to music, I love bass a lot but I would recommand to others that you would listen to them from a source that you could adjust the bass level (bass knob or equalizer), so that way you won`t get too much bass from them.\\nVery good headphones ...

I get about 9 - 12 continuous hours of battery operation (depending on battery quality) and the unit captures voices flawlessly during my calls (I have an adapter for the phone). I have used this in a seminar setting and have had great results. I highly recommend using rechargeable batteries (always have one extra on hand) when you are going to use the unit for extended periods of time. Recharge before your event each day and you won't miss a thing. The unit only uses one battery and it's always a great idea to have a spare. The unit does not audibly warn when the battery is about to expire, so keeping a fresh charge should provide you with uninterrupted recordings. Each stop and restart begins a new file. For me that works great! If you are looking for one continuous file, do not shut it off. You can also buy software that will let you merge the files for your later use. You would be hard pressed to find a better product for the money\\n</review_text>,\n",

My only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters, it does not offer a dash or hyphen, so when one is  required, I find myself using a star instead. That is a minor complaint though.

Neither charged the iPod (The Belkin required batteries, which only lasted about 15 hours of use), while the iTrip worked OK at first, but then started getting static no matter what station I used. In fact, I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away (and then, it was still not clear). The sound isn't as loud as some (it takes over the volume control, so you cant use the volume on the iPod.) Still, it's not nearly as soft as some I've seen. I found most music came through at a good volume (I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up). This unit, although it seems cheap and flimsy at first, is able to get a consistant, strong signal, even on stations which usually come in clearly. It powers through them, and the result is a very clean sound. It is a little hard to read at the regular angle, but once you set the 3 presets, you don't need to see the screen.

I purchased it from Dell for $480 with aluminum hardcase, extra 1100mAh battery, and auto power cord.\\n\\nStrengths: Just about everything.  The processor is absolutely incredible.  I heard (unconfirmed) that the Intel 624 MHz PXA270 is faster than a 2GHz Pentium 3!  It sure seems like it.  This PDA blazes through movies, photos, games, word processing, and anything else I can throw at it.  \\nThe other definite high point for this PDA is the screen.  Once you see a VGA screen like this, you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a QVGA screen.  I have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels.  The screen is crystal clear.  \\nThe battery life is phenomenal, even with the standard low capacity battery.  Playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours, extended to about 4.5 hours on low brightness and headphones.  Turned off with a 1GB SD card drains the battery about 2% per day.  \\nWiFi is amazing.  It connects consistently and is moderately easy to set up.  Once connected, it keeps the signal well and is, while not fast, reasonable for speed\\nJust about everything on this PDA is almost perfect.\\n\\nWeaknesses: Not enough programs to start with, Windows Media Player 10 (Download TCPMP, it's way better)\\n\\nProblems: Don't use Odyssey Client, it makes the PDA start up really slow.  Also, in ActiveSync, On the PDA, select Menu, Add Server Source.  On all of the screens, put random characters in each field, and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize.  Then go to menu, schedule and select manual for both.  Then go to menu, options, and delete the entry that you just added (the one that has no boxes under it checked) and delete it.  It fixes a myriad of problems and makes the PDA run faster, and it still syncs automatically in the cradle.\\n\\nConclusion: An awesome PDA that does just about everything.  Combine it with a BT keyboard and perhaps even a BT mouse, and you have an unbeatable combination of power and portability.  Everything works extremely well\\n</review_text>,\n",

The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply.  The sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that I own.  Many people comment on the bass issue.  For travel speakers, the Traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion.  True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative's website).  I'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience.  The jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit.  Also, the Microphoto charges while docked, whether it's playing or not.  There's even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also).  By the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3's, adjust volume, and play/pause/FF/Rew.

       " <review_text>\\nEchoing most other reviews here, this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money.  But buying them is a risk! If you don't wear these earphones correctly, they sound terrible, easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones.  Those unsatisfied with the sound quality (especially those complaining of lack of bass) either haven't put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears.\\n\\nLearning how to put them in properly takes time.  Be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions.  Once you teach yourself how to put them in, it will only take a few seconds.  Some tips: Before inserting the earbuds, draw the phones up from behind your ear, holding the earbuds in the correct orientation (drivers pointing medially), so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals. With one hand, pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other.  This straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone.  (Your doctor uses the same maneuver when he/she examines you with an otoscope.) You may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better.  If the phones are properly inserted, they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your Eustachian tubes (that is, swallow), just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator.\\n\\nIt may seem like it takes a lot of work (and possibly learning a bit about anatomy) to get these earphones to work as intended.  It does, and success is not guaranteed.  But it's worth it! And to save your hearing, don't forget to turn down the volume, since your music will no longer have to compete with outside noise\\n</review_text>,\n",

I went back to Best Buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the Westinghouse could be improved. He said it was as it good as it could be. He than said the Sharp was twice the price of the Westinghouse, so I should expect a better picture on the Sharp.In any event, I purchased the Sharp on Amazon during the recent Electronic Express Sale. On HD, the picture is amazing. It's also quite good on regular TV. \\nMy only regret is that Toshiba has just come out with a 37inch LCD with a DVD built in.

Here's my quick impression after using these headphones for a week:\\n\\nPros:\\n1. Very good bass &amp; well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71, the ER4p has tight but the least bass-feel/effect.)  Mid-range is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.)\\n2. Easy to drive (with the iM716 phones, I'd need to crank up the vol.)\\n3. Very light weight\\n4. Comfortable tips (3 sizes included)\\n5. Decent isolation from outside noise (the ER4p &amp;iM716 have better isolation)\\n6. Moderately priced ($50)\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Cables are thin so handle with care.\\n2. Some people may not like the \"phonendoscope effect\" (cables frictions.)  This is very common with IEM headphones, some are more than others.\\n3. No pouch or case\\n\\nPS: For bass-heads, you will like these IEMs - from an owner of Beyer DT770-80's experience :\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nAll in-ear headphones will make some noise when the wires brush up against something.  Sound travels along wires... it's physics, there's nothing you can do about that.  Now, these earphones are incredibly light-weight and the wires are thin so that actually reduces the noise traveling through the wires.  \\n\\nThese headphones are called \"asymmetric,\" meaning that the right earbud is on a longer wire than the left.  You wear this by putting the wire on the right earbud BEHIND your neck.  This leaves the area in front of you clear of wires that could get tangled up in your hands.  This also makes it easy to each lunch while listening to music so your food doesn't spill on the wire.\\n\\nI paid about 60 bucks and for that price, I love these headphones.  Face it, these are low to mid-range in terms of price, but perform more like mid-range to high range if you ask me.  The cable is thin and flexible yet seems pretty resistant to damage.  The buds are comfy and I like the asymmetric design.  People need to realize that there are premium headphones for $500 or more.  I think people need to keep perspective and not have TOO high expectations from only a $60 pair\\n</review_text>,\n",

The new ones aren't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out. I don't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me! The new color coating is scratch resistant, but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol. But you don't notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos.

These sound nice, full- the bass doesn't thump like a lot of people like but to my ears it's smooth.  And most important, you can listen for hours without ear fatigue.

My office is between the shop, where we make rocket engines, and the flight line on the airport, where airplanes are tested.

       " <review_text>\\nI've bought several of these cables and have been very happy with my purchase.  I've used them for hooking up my Gaming Systems, TV, Cable Box, and Receiver/DVD Player.  (Note: I had to buy a small 3 in 1 Fiber Optic Switch Box to handle all these cables -my Receiver and TV only had one digital audio connection each.)\\n\\nI believe that these cables are the best name brand VALUES currently around for Fiber Optic Audio.\\n\\nWhat do you REALLY get for a \"high end\" fiber optic cable that is triple the cost of this cable? I don't know.  I purchased one (which was \"top of the line\") and obscenely expensive, and of course it sounds great, but these cables sound great too.  Plus, these cables ARE Monster cables, AND they are THX certified!\\n\\nWhat does THX certification mean? Below is a blurb taken directly from the THX website describing it:\\n---\\n\"THX is on the forefront of entertainment technology, offering products and services of unparalleled quality for post-production, distribution and playback of audio and visual content. THX Certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry, offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance.\"\\n\\n---\\nA digital signal is a digital signal.  This is fiber optic cable -it uses light to transmit the digital data -it doesn't degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable.  So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables, they just are going be a little less durable, and probably use slightly less high quality materials.  Are they fragile? Not at all, but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily.  If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable.  (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly -i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).\\n\\nOverall, I'm very happy with these cables and can I afford to buy a bunch for all the fiber optic audio connections I am now using (i.e. Receiver, TV, Cable Box, Xbox/Playstation/Gamecube)\\n\\n(P.S. for first time users, don't forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables.  These are there to protect the cable during transit/storage and will prevent the light from passing unless removed.  Throw these tips away; you'll never need them again.\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI purchased the Notebook Cooler approximately one month ago, after reading online testimonials of laptops becoming damaged from overheating. Thankfully, the same time I read that, Circuit City was having a sale on this item for only $15, after mail-in rebate. Fast forward one month and my opinion of the Cooler so far: not bad... \\n\\nMy laptop is noticeably cooler to the touch now, and the internal fan rarely comes on. The Notebook Cooler itself is smartly designed, with an aluminum topping and two fans that draw away heat. I'll admit, the USB connector cable is a bit flimsy, and I can see why some folks have complained. For those users who travel frequently (or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often), you may want to exercise extra caution. The blue LED light that some reviewer claims is too \"strong\" is a minor quibble--if you really wanted to, you could always tape over the light and problem solved. As for the fan noise, I would say the low setting is comparable to \"white noise,\" which you don't really notice until you purposely try to listen for it! The high setting, on the other hand, is a bit loud, and I can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or TV to compensate. Usually, though, I only use the high setting when it's really hot in the room, or if I'm running intensive programs like Photoshop or some video game. \\n\\nOverall, I'd say I'm very satisfied with this product. (Though, I am somewhat disappointed that Antec needs 3 months to process my $15 rebate check.) \\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI bought two pairs of these when I saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each.  They've both gotten extensive use over the past couple years.  The cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that I suppose imitates leather in looks and feel.  This outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs, which makes it look raggedy, but the comfort and sound quality isn't affected by it so I don't consider it a big deal.   The headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it \"should,\" but likewise, it's something to be expected with this much use and hasn't affected comfort.\\n\\nThe cable is also thicker than most headphone cables I'm used to, which is good news for people who find themselves constantly rolling over cables with their chairs and such.\\n\\nI've compared the sound quality to the Koss QZ-50's (which I own) and a library's Koss UR-10's or 15's (can't remember which).  Though the QZ-50's do sound better when they have their active noise cancelling feature turned on, the UR-20's are the most comfortable of the three, have the richest bass, are the most durable, and won't eat up your AAA batteries like the QZ-50's\\n</review_text>,\n",

The buttons on both of these Logitech mice press down really nicely and are effortless.  This was not so on the MS 6000.\\n\\nIf you are looking for the ultimate in a mouse for a notebook, the Logitech V450 is it.  My hands are fairly large, and for the $15 more than the v200, it is definitely worth it as I spend a lot of time on computers\\n</review_text>,\n",

The corded handset base unit can be used to make and receive calls even when the electricity is off.  This, along with price, was the main reason I bought this phone system.

       " <review_text>\\nThese DVDs are absolutely top quality, and you really need to use bad DVDs to know how bad they can get.  I ordered a pack a while ago and have burnt 7 discs so far.  Not a single coaster, and Nero data verification (I always do that for DVDs) has not brought up any errors ever.  BTW, the discs had a mixture of both large and very small files.  The burner is the DVD multi drive on my Dell Inspiron Laptop (1505).\\n\\nHowever, I should mention (to those who haven't bought this product) why they are called Shiny Silver.  You know that print on the top of DVDs with lines and that matte finish?  Well, there's no such thing on these DVDs.  The top looks a lot like the writing surface on the other side (other than the characteristic DVD color).  Anyone who has seen unbranded DVDs will know exactly what I'm talking about- No special surface; however  a felt tip marker works nicely to label the disks.

       " <review_text>\\nFirst off, these puppies sound good! However, there are things anyone intending to buy these earphones should know:\\n\\nThe sound is loud and crisp but definetely mid-trebley, as with most in-ear headphones. The low end is there, but for full effect, it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume. Since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves, this sweet spot is not very wide. That said, however, I recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small. Most bass-rich systems utilize either massive speakers/ woofers or chambered enclosures (or both) to deliver. Since the size of this type of headphones doesn't permit for either big speakers or special chambers, maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber! I am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for. Such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package. Maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard (for the price they better be).  So if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback, look into buying those pricey phones.  The lack of such bass is the only reason \\ni didn't give it five stars.\\n\\nAlso, the lack of colored LEFT (blue or white) &amp; RIGHT (red) tags on the earphones make it tricky to put on for the first time. I didn't realize I had them reversed until the pain got so unbearable I just had to check.  So be careful.\\n\\nRiding while using them can be dangerous, since the sound isolation is so great one can barely hear jets thundering overhead. \\n\\nBang for the buck, ( I paid $69.99 on amazon), I really recommend these headphones to all but big bass aficionados.\\n</review_text>,\n",

The people at Samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best I have seen well documented with pictures (in full color) and just that step-by-step for the novice.  The setup diagram is excellent.  The features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize (any disc) and away you go.  One touch record starts immediately.  The quality is superb especially in High Definition.

Finalizing discs is a snap and easy I have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the Samsung is so easy the on-screen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers! It will play mp3s, CDs, computer made DivX movies, Region 1 DVDs, Picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly.  You can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer's codes which they list in a handy guide.

The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs, raher than, as on my brother's mp3 player, needing to press \"next\" everytime you change the song. The backlight is fine, and does it's job; my one complaint on that would be that, as I mainly use it on the bus at 6:00 am, it is quite bright and hurts my eyes.\\n\\nAnother huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod \"family\" is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them. I myself have a case, an iSkin which I have come to adore, high quality headphones and the iBass, which is another great speaker product for ipods.

Achieving good wireless connection is not always easy, could require pressing the tune-in button several times\\n2. Interference noises could sneak into the broadcast\\n3. Turning them off could be annoying (requires precise timing)\\n\\nMy experience: I've had two pairs of these for over a year and I like them very much. I enjoy great sound watching TV or listening to music while everybody is asleep. This is really great, I can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night. The sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the TV. You have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the TV (closet or the garage for example). The headphones are light and very comfortable. I tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far. So, overall wonderful product. However, there a few flaws to be aware of. Consider the following before buying. It might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel. Sometimes, turning the headphones ON results in poor reception if any at all. To correct this, you have to press the only button (power, search, and turn off) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel. You might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying. Once you get good reception, everything is ok although you might get some interference (alien noises) when you turn your head or move around. The last problem is with the turn off button (again the only multifunction button). You need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit. That is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on. You think you turned it off but it is still on and if it's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely. Well, I hope my description is helpful. \\n\\nRegardless of the flaws, I recommend the AW771. I use them every day and best of all I enjoy great sound when other people are asleep. \\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set (a Midiland 5.1 system) was thoroughly aged and falling apart I decided it was time to upgrade.  I wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd's.  I shopped around and came to the conclusion I would aim for the form factor speakers.  When considering this bose system, this MUST be taken into account.    \\n\\nFirst off, this system is expensive.  For just under 1000 dollars (doesn't 999 sound sooo much better than 1g?) you get 5 bi-directional midrange speakers, the subwoofer unit, and speaker cable.  At this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver, but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget.  Bose includes 3 colors (white, silver, black) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit (a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not). \\n \\nWhat brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness.  For their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any sound-granted they are paired with a competent receiver.  Anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through, without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store.  \\n\\nOnce I got the system home it was very easy to set up and install.  Bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong to-a very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system.  The only serious issue I have with this system ended up being with my receiver (an Onkyo) and not related at all with the speakers.  \\n\\nSince I do run this through my computer (presently a laptop) I had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver, but when that was all said and done, I was extremely please with the system.  With a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tag-its target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges.  \\n\\nMy test soundtracks included:  Gladiator, Matrix (II or III), Snatch, and music tracks ranging from techno, rock, classical, and alternative.  Everything sounded great with enough low, high, and midrange response.  The second complaint I have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites.  I found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers weren't drowning out the voices.  That was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there.  \\n\\nAll in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs (though draining my bank account) and providing me with great surround sound.\\n\\nGood:  Great range and volume of sound.  Easy set-up.  Well built speakers-aesthetically and physically.  No interference or feedback.\\n\\nBad:  Subwoofer awkward, no dedicated center channel, pricey, no included receiver.\\n\\nFor their size these speakers more than compete with any full-blown tower 5.1 system.  Here is one satisfied customer\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\n\\nJust a quick note to say that it is a pity that people buy 'toys' before exploring what it is that they're buying.  I have seen people knock the SanDisk U3 drives, as well as U3 drive made by other companies.  Well the reality is that:\\n\\na- The U3 software has a way of stopping the software's auto-boot.\\n\\nb- There is Uninstall software available at at SanDisk.com and at U3.com, and I'm guessing that those company's that offer U3 and have a web site probably have the 'Uninstaller' on their site.\\n\\nc- There is a great deal of U3 software available (free and pay-for-it) at U3.com.  I know that SanDisk has a software site, so do Verbatim &amp; Memorex.\\n\\nd- For those who want portable software but don't want U3 or don't have a U3 drive, go to http://portableapps.com.  Note: some of the software here is the same used by the U3 folks, without using the U3 LaunchPad.\\n\\ne- Quality of drives: remember that when you buy most of the electronics 'toys' available today, you are buying Chinese c*** (junk).  Both the manufacturing and Quality Control (QC) are garbage.  Unless you are paying serious change for something ($500+) you will get passable junk.  If you are expecting \"made in Japan quality\" your kidding yourself.  This is the reason you will see many Brand Name goods, also selling with No-Name labels (i.e Coby).  Same production line, different labels.  It is also one of the reason folks are impressed with Apple iPods.  Apple demands excellent QC, and the destruction of goods that don't meet the standard.  In exchange you are willing to pay a 20% premium for this level of QC.  Like everything in life, ya gets whats ya pay for.\\n\\ng- Since the beginning of Windows (v1.0, et al) there have always been buggy and uncooperative software programs, there will always be pain in the a** software.  One of the reasons XP has such a prominent 'roll-back' feature.  And also the reason many, if not MOST, power users run multiple machines.  Of course, these days we have to fill Billy G's pockets by having to buy multiple paks of XP.  Most of my power-user friends run at least three or four machines, each one with a different use.  It shouldn't be this way, but the reality is that for folk that use or explore a great deal of software, for many purposes (MP3's, scanning, Video, controlling radios, composing music, et al), one machine won't cut it because XP ain't as stable as folks think.  The more programs, and the more varied in type, the more instability is introduced into ANY Windows installation. Why do you think businesses run Win2000 or Win2003, because there are less software 'toys' that run under 2K, and the 'admin' can prevent you from loading a lot of software 'toys'.\\n\\nh- In the end, understand what you are buying before you buy so that you'll have better luck getting what you want, and you won't look so ignorant when you say something that anyone who has bothered to go to the web site(s) knows is dead wrong, or just plain stupid.\\n\\ni- When you truly understand the product, you'll be able to write TRULY useful reviews, and that what all readers want, useful information.\\n\\nTo one and all, may your 'toys' keep you happy\\n</review_text>,\n",

Like the talking caller ID and being able to screen messages from any of the phones. I also like being able to program a phone directory into one phone and transfering (download) a single entry or the entire list to the other phones. And each phone is also a speaker phone and a full intercom.\\n\\nYou can name the phones for the rooms they will occupy which will help when you use the intercom to call a specific room. So you would page the \"Living Rm\" rather than phone #3, etc.\\n\\nIf you have caller ID, you can program special rings and special call ID colors for the callers in your phone directory but that information must be programmed into each phone. It doesn't transfer when you download the directory to the other phones. \\n\\nAlso, on another Panasonic wireless phone that I own, the incoming call displayed the name I had programmed into the phone directory. Just like your cell phone will say \"home\", etc. On this phone, the caller ID displays the telephone company info only. \\n\\nI think the phone is great, I just wanted to clarify some points that are not crystal clear in the literature.\\n\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at Ebay 2 pairs of JBL E20s and 1 Pair E30s, an E25 center speaker and a Harmon Kardon AVR. I got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of E20s and the E30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend. \\n\\nThe E20s and E30s are listed as \"Bookshelf Speakers.\" The E20s ARE bookshelf speakers. As I wrote in my review of the E20s, the E30s can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is Kong and your first name is King! The E20s are heavy at 7lbs each, not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are. The E30s are HEAVY. HEAVY! 16 lbs each. (That is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs!) They are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep. They need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor. \\n\\nI am very pleased with both the E20s and E30s. For small speakers, the E20s have some oomph and can be cranked up. The E30s have OOOMMPHHHH. They WANT to be cranked up. Yesterday I tried them out by listening to my mp3 files of the Animals Singles and Paul Revere and the Raiders Kicks. When cranked up, the E30s sound at least 1000% better than the the E20s.  I hooked them up to my vintage JVC AV receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power. At a little over half volume my ears began to hurt. You can really feel the bass and the drums kick. \\n\\nI also listened to about 2 hours of The Doors via Rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver. I have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the 60s. The E30s are simply incredible! They brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh.\\n\\nMy biggest surprise with the E30s is that they sound very good at lower volumes, not as good as the E20s, but still very good. As I write, I am watching/listening to a DVD of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons concertos performed by Herbert Von Karajan, the BPO and Anne-Sophie Mutter on fiddle and am running the E30s and E20s at about 15% volume--pretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver. Yet I can still HEAR everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord. Since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels, I am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums. \\n\\nI bought the E30s for under $90 including s/h. Back in the early 80s or late 70s I spent more than four times this amount (adjusted for inflation) for 2 large, heavy Advent Loudspeakers with 8\" woofers. The E30s clearly sound better than I ever remember the Advents sounding including better bass response, and I liked the Advents! Over time, our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper. You still can spend mega bucks and buy a $10,000 McIntosh system (or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as I saw at one website!) It all depends on what your budget is. The JBLs are a great value offering tremendous perfomance for those who are budget minded\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nFirst off, let me say that this is a VERY impressive monitor.  My points of reference for that statement are my other three LCD monitors: three Samsung models, two of which are 913Ns and the other is a 712N.  These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic, and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic.  Surprisingly, I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic, but, for my taste and needs, the Samsungs are simply too bright, and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.  For high light, daytime use, I have found that I do like to have the brightness all the way up on the ViewSonic, but I truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being.\\n\\nInstallation was simple: in fact, something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that, interestingly again, the drivers that are on the ViewSonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation CD, even though the driver package that is posted on the ViewSonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago.  When I first installed this monitor and turned it on, I truly do not think the picture was as clear, or the graphics as rich, as any of the Samsung monitors that I own.  But, and this is another tip for new users of this product, the default setting for the ViewSonic screen contrast was set MUCH lower than the maximum setting.  When I increased the contrast up to its maximum setting, I believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal, if not fully equal, to those on the other LCDs that I own.\\n\\nOne big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a DVI cable included, so you save that added expense (this isn't true with all ViewSonics).  And, especially with the digital connection, I have no doubts about ViewSonic's claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the Samsungs.  I have to admit that I wasn't sure I needed a widescreen display, but I believe it's going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones!  This is a really a fine monitor!\\n\\nNow for a few small negatives.  One reason I haven't purchased ViewSonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers.  I already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer, so I really have no use for monitor speakers.  Additionally, those ViewSonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Strains my neck.  The reason I really didn't worry about it on this monitor was because, while there are speakers, they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other ViewSonic monitors.  With that said, I have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than I had expected.  For example, on the 17 inch Samsung monitor, the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4\" from the desktop.  On the 19 inch Samsungs, it is 4 inches.  On this ViewSonic, the bottom of the screen is 5 1/2 inches above the desktop.  It's not bad, but it's going to take a bit of getting used to.  If all else fails, other monitor stands are available.\\n\\nAs with most electronic products these days, there is very little in the way of documentation.  The 87 billion language installation card tells diddly.  The .PDF manual that is installed on the computer simply says the standard self-explanatory things.  However, I found the interactive help program on the manufacturer's website be quite useful in helping fix a few small problems, surprisingly.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm very impressed so far, and I'm really looking forward to using this monitor!  By the by, shipping from Amazon.com was amazingly fast: it shipped the next day, and it arrived the day after that.  I can't complain about that speed!  My only question is why they would need a weight surcharge on this but could ship an extremely heavy wood lathe for free?  Go figure!  Anyway, a solid four stars for this monitor\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nThe sound quality is pretty darn good, except that if you pace around while talking/listening, there are these annoying clicking/scratching sounds.  They are quite, and, if you stand still they go away.  I've had other phones that click/scratch while pacing around, and they actually dropped some of the sound during the clicking - at least this phone doesn't do that.  \\n\\nMy 900 MHz DSS Uniden didn't have these sounds (while pacing or otherwise), and still had greater range.  I don't know why the new technology can't measure up.  Still though, this is the best 5.8 I've tried.  (Yet I'd rather buy another 900MHz DSS if there were any on the market anymore.  All of today's 900MHz are analog instead of digital.)\\n\\nAnother annoying thing is that you can't recharge the phone with the belt clip attached, so the clip goes on and off (and on and off).

Also, Amazon had the best price by far and it shipped to my house in a timely manner with no major issues.   \\nI mainly use this TV for my XBOX 360.  You will NOT be disappointed if you are planning on doing the same.   The game mode does enhance the picture a great deal as well.  I provides sort of an Anti Aliasing effect smoothing out some of the rough edges. All in all, after owning the tv for about 2 months now, I couldn't be happier.   To get around the poor speakers, I just plug in a nice set of headphones and games sound GREAT.  \\nI've also hooked up an HD antenna and regular cable.  HD channels have a very good picture over the air.  Some football games almost look better on this than on my 42\" Samsung DLP downstairs with the HD Cable.  There's also a nice Antenna button on the remote which quickly swaps between cable and the Over the Air Antenna.  \\nThe only drawbacks to the TV are the 1 component input and the fact you can't use the PIP with the cable connected, only the antenna.  \\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI had a Zen Vision:M but I returned it because I decided I didn't need quite that much storage capacity and the hard drive seemed to sputter and whirr too often and I wanted the peace of mind that comes with owning a flash player compared to a hard drive player, so I decided to go with the Zen V since it's interface is almost identical to that of the Zen Vision M's(which I liked).\\n\\nThe first thing you will notice is the physical design.  Initially I wasn't that impressed, but it's really grown on me.  The height x width dimensions are comparitively much much smaller than the iPod nano.  You can actually wrap your entire hand around the device, and the soft finish feels very nice in your hand.  The second color that fills the seams of the player is a very nice touch as well.\\n\\nThe music is organized your standard Artist-Album-Song interface that is becoming quite a bit stale in my opinion. Still, it's as simple as you can get I suppose.  The device officially supports album art although it seems to be very hit-or-miss in that regard in my experience. The screen is vibrant and colorful but is very hard to see in bright sunlight.\\n\\n The middle joystick is used for navigation and it works very well in that regard, although wedging your thumb underneath to move upward can be tricky sometimes and result in an accidental button push.  A dedicated volume control switch is found on the side and a hold switch on top.  \\n\\nThe player syncs with WMP11 via USB connection.  Syncing it is a snap although I was not impressed with the transfer speeds. Also, if you sync the tracks on your player back to another computer, album art will not be attached to the music tracks.\\n\\nIf you are a newbie to buying MP3 players make note of the different sized models.  The 2GB model for instance advertises that it holds 1000 songs but these figures are theoretical maximums based on low quality files.  Most of my files are mid bit-rate WMAs and I can fit about 500 songs on the player, half as much as advertised.  \\n\\nSummary:\\n\\nPros:\\nExcellent physical design\\nEasy to use interface\\nGood navigation\\nGreat sound quality\\n\\nCons:\\nOn-the-go playlist creation is flawed\\nAlbum art support hit-or-miss\\nSlow transfer speeds from WMP11\\nAccesories rarely available in brick-and-mortar stores\\n\\nUltimately, I recommend the Zen V over the iPod nano mostly on the strength of it's vastly superior physical design. \\n\\n\\n\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI have had these speakers for over a month and I love them they sound awesome. They were delivered quickly and they were brand new as described\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI read the other reviews for these speakers so I had very high expectations. I can only say WOW! The premium price (compared with lesser 2.1 speaker systems) is absolutely justified\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nFor reference, I've owned a set of Labtec APX-6420 2.1 speakers for about 6-7 years now. With the purchase of a a new computer (Mac Pro + Cinema Display) I decided it was also time to upgrade my speakers. I spent a very long time mulling over different brands and models, listening to them in stores whenever possible. Of the major \"PC speaker\" makers, I recall sampling Altec Lansing, Logitech, Klipsch, Bose, Creative, and JBL. Aside from listening in stores (a poor environment) I also took into account personal experience with the brands (mostly the first three I listed) in regular \"home\" situations.\\n\\nI initially wanted the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1's because of the fantastic reviews they've gotten on Amazon and elsewhere, but was turned off to them because of the apparently poor build quality (parts breaking very quickly), along with reports of buzzing, the power switch being on the back of the subwoofer, my impression of them in stores, and experience with a friend's ProMedia 4.1's (which neither I nor him really cared for, and which recently broke).\\n\\nI tried as many Logitech speakers as I could in many different situations and  decided I HATE ALL OF THEM (with the sole exception of the Z-5500's which I own and love)! The bass especially sucks on their speakers.\\n\\nSo... through all this I eventually came to the conclusion that Altec Langsing was the brand I wanted to go with. And if that was so, it had to be the FX6021's which I had been eyeing for years. The first time I heard them in a store I declared them my favorite of the selection at the time and the same is still true. These are probably the best sub-$200 2.1 PC speakers you can buy. Even at their MSRP of $250 they're probably worth it. These speakers a very nice!\\n\\nThe sound is very clear and sharp. Get ready to hear all the distortion in your low bitrate digital audio files. The speakers especially shine when listen to live recordings or anything that was produced by real instruments (i.e. not techno, though that sounds good too).\\n\\nSubwoofer is NOT \"boomy\" or \"buzzy\" like others have reported. I never use the equalizer in iTunes and have the bass at about half. It's very deep, rich, and discrete. Doesn't shake the floor or cause my neighbors to complain--yes, I live in an apartment too and bass is a concern of mine. For those who complain about the bass: maybe you shouldn't have gotten 2.1 speakers? Maybe your units were defective? Or perhaps the subwoofer was placed in a very poor position? I know sound is highly subjective, but those reviews just don't sound right to me.\\n\\nPROs:\\n* Tall, sleek, and sexy satellites provide a nice wall of sound and match the Cinema Display perfectly.\\n* Bass and treble have a *large* range of adjustability. 50% of either is plenty enough for me.\\n* Power button on control pod\\n* This is important: NO BUZZING. Not while they're on, not while they off. 100% silent.\\n\\nCONs:\\n* Volume adjustment is digital and moves in \"notches\"; these notches aren't always small enough. I much prefer a regular analog knob.\\n* Remote is a bit useless\\n* While they look good and perform well, they feel a little cheap\\n* Get ready for lots of cables hanging from your desk and all over the floor (on the other hand, long cables are a PRO as well)\\n\\nAnd finally, don't be fooled by specs. Yes, other speakers may have more watts of power and THX certification, but that really doesn't matter as much as it might seem. These are more than loud enough for any sane person (100% volume would probably wake up the neighborhood). I really didn't pay any attention to the specs, I bought them because they sound the best\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI've owned these Altec's for over three years now, and I have yet to ever coming close to replacing them - as a matter of fact, when facing the decision of buying another set of speakers for a new computer, I went ahead and still purchased these babies!\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY --- the sound quality is very crisp and excellent overall - I have used mine for video editing, and I'm very pleased with how clear the dialogue audio has come through, in addition to the special effects sound - unless you need a five speaker system (or comparable) then I'm confident that this is the most crisp sound you'll find in any speaker\\n\\nVOLUME --- these suckers can get LOUD - just take my word for it\\n\\nCOMPATIBILITY --- This is the part I love most - there is no software to install and no special plugs - the speakers plug right in, and very easily, into the audio jack, just like a pair of headphones would --- thus, hooking in a computer, iPod, cd-player, etc, is easy as heck, making these speakers extremely universal for any sound equipment\\n\\nCONTROLS --- the speaker system comes with a seperate remote, giving one access to adjust the volume, bass, and treble, all seperately from the computer's controls -- the knob to control the volume, and other functions, is easy to use and makes for quick adjustments\\n\\nSIZE --- the speakers are extremely thin and the subwoofer is a very manageable size -- placing these speakers is easy\\n\\nPRICE --- believe me - it's a bargain at under $200!!!\\n\\nOverall, I give my full recommendation here -- you'll love these speakers\\n</review_text>,\n",

It also seems to improve Pandora internet radio streams even more than my mp3's, though I have to keep the volume at about 3/4 in the Pandora player to prevent distortion. If you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo, I'm not sure if this card will do much for the sound, but it might\\n</review_text>,\n",

I like it so much, I'm getting ready to purchase another one just to use at work.  I used a Microsoft Explorer mouse prior and thought I'd never find a mouse that was as comforable to use and had all the extra buttons I needed.  This mouse completely puts the Explorer to shame.  It took me a few minutes to get used to how quickly it responds but I soon caught on.  I really didn't care for the glowing or the chameleon paint on it.  That's not why I got it, although it does look pretty cool.  As for gaming, I really didn't notice much improvment in my skill but it REALLY does feel better in your hand.  The bottom of the mouse it curved in so you can grip it much easier.\\n\\nMy only negative comment towards it is how cheesy the driver and gui is for it as it looks \"homemade\".\\n\\nI would highly recommend this mouse for anyone who spends any time at all on a PC\\n</review_text>,\n",

It's really super sensitive and has improved my accuracy quite a bit.  I do have a few gripes with it's design, but with 1600dpi that can be overlooked!  Oh, it looks cool when the lights are out the chameleon green paint is a trip.\\n\\nDesign problems that I have noticed... Buttons squeak, button placement is not optimal, it's kinda small for people with big hands, programmable buttons take to much force to operate which can cause erratic mouse movement. If you have a second mouse to do your work with this makes a great gaming specific mouse, highly recommended\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI decided to upgrade my laptop with the wpc54gs from the wpc54g.  I did this because the \"g\" card would randomly disconnect when the WEP or WPA security was activated.

       " <review_text>\\nI recently bought a new 6.0 megapixel digital camera (Canon PowerShot S3 IS) which came with an extremely small and  practically useless 16MB secure digital card so I bought a couple of these 1GB PNY PSD1GRF3 secure digital cards since they were on sale for less than $20 apiece.  These SD cards are made in Japan by Toshiba (they are then rebranded and sold by PNY, Lexar, DaneElec, etc.) and I have been very pleased with them so far.  They work flawlessly with no write-speed delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound, and the card reader in my HP Pavilion M7480N Media Center PC (running Windows XP Professional service pack 2) reads the pictures and video into my Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 and Premiere Elements 2.0 software programs with no problems.  The only drawback is that the read-speed on these standard SD cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster SD cards...it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full 1GB card onto my PC...but I find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem.  So, if a little longer read time is not a problem for you, then save yourself some money and buy this card.  Overall, a very good standard SD card at an excellent price!     \\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI bought this package purely for the keyboard. I wanted a new one with wireless technology and I was driven to Bluetooth just because it is so reliable. I do not use the keyboard and mouse together, however.\\n\\nThe keyboard is one of the most comfortable keyboards I've ever used. I am a computer programmer so having a nice keyboard is essential. The pad at the bottom is very comfortable and the keys are very well spaced and organized. The only real compliant is they cut some corners with the home, end, page up, page down, and delete keys. They moved them around from the conventional way which I still haven't gotten used to but it's fine.\\n\\nI have experience no lag with either the mouse or the keyboard. I play a game called StepMania (a sort of Dance Dance Revolution clone for PC) which requires very accurate timing with the keyboard. I've experienced no problems here, it's spot on and probably the fastest ever. The only problem, really, is it takes a while to register if you haven't use the keyboard for a while since it must turn back on from sleep mode and reconnect. After that however, there are no problems at all.\\n\\nI do not use the mouse with the keyboard. I decided to use it as a mouse with my iBook since it had built-in bluetooth. I had absolutely no problems connecting the two devices and it works flawlessly. I don't use the mouse very much, but the times I do use it I experience no problems.\\n\\nBoth the range on the mouse and the keyboard are extremely nice. I can go anywhere in my room with either the mouse or keyboard and experience no problems.\\n\\nThe battery life on the keyboard is also very nice, esspecially since it has the built-in sleep feature. I have had to replace the batteries once since I got the unit in January of 06 (currently June of 06). I have not had to replace the mouse batteries yet, but I do not use it very much.\\n\\nOthers complained about not being able to use the keyboard in the BIOS or startup screens, but I haven't had any issues with that. It depends on how recent your motherboard is, and mine is relatively new so I had no problems.\\n\\nI highly recommend this setup to anyone wanting a wireless keyboard or mouse, or if you want to split and use the mouse with a laptop and keyboard with a desktop. Either way, you cannot go wrong with this package, it is extremely excellent\\n</review_text>,\n",

I was a little hesitant at first because I don't think I ever spent over $40 on a pair of headphones. I finally decided to invest in these because I spend most of my free time listening to music. I received these the other day, and immediately plugged them into my ipod. Please don't let the breaking in period discourage you! After these become comfortable, you will hear music you have never heard before even when you are listening to songs you have heard thousands of time.\\n\\nI started with all my heavy bass tracks, and couldn't believe how they sounded with these headphones.

If you are just a casual music listener, I would say just go with a good pair of cheap ones, you will save a lot of money.

       " <review_text>\\nThis is the Ultimate Ears Super fi model especially designed for \"bassheads,\" featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies. I don't think UE would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature. Yes, the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed, but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction.\\n\\nOn the bright side, however, the bass reproduction is  marvelous. Not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones I've ever used, the quality is excellent. The bass is tight and pleasant, neither boomy nor thumpy. This overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the UE 5 EB's ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented \"front and center,\" including techno bass (aka \"car audio bass\"), drum n' bass, and many types of rap/hip-hop. For music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall, opinions will vary. With rock music, for example, the strong bass is certainly a plus, but I have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly, and some detail is lost.\\n\\nIt should be noted that this bass-dominated sound signature renders the EB's a good choice for people who own iPods and feel that their music player is weak on bass. Without any EQ adjustment, the iPod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is PRESENT. \\n\\nIn terms of build, the EB's superficially seem well-constructed and designed. I have heard complaints, however, that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage. Be careful out there! Thoughtfully, EB has includes a variety of ear tips with these IEM's (including foam, flanged, and plain) so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit. The EB's don't extend deeply into the ear canal, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal, comfort is good and isolation decent. However, if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating. Making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the EB's.\\n\\nOh, and some people think that the EB's look kind of strange when worn. Larger than the higher-priced Super fi 5 Pro model, the EB's stick out a bit. Your call as to whether this is a problem.\\n\\nLike all of the UE IEM's in this series, the EB's are packaged with a nice set of accessories, including a 1/4\" adapter plug, a sound attenuator, a soft travel case, an earwax loop, and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with IEM's, cord tangling.\\n\\nIt's unlikely that the EB's will prove satisfactory as your \"everyday\" earphone unless you listen solely to bass-dominant types of music. The truth is, however, that even for bass-heavy music the overall sound signature of the Super fi 5 Pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users (I own both). But as a second pair specifically for use with bass-y music, the EB's are well-designed and definitely fun\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nThis is the 2nd Gamepad I've owned (My first PC was in 1993).  The 1st gamepad was the Gravis Gamepad (4-button + D-Pad).  I recently upraded and there is no GAME/MIDI port on the new system, plus I need more buttons for Need For Speed Most Wanted, etc.\\n\\nI love this controller.  I've had it for two days and have had nothing but excellent results.  I've only used it in NFS games (I have them all).\\n\\nThe WiFi works flawlessly and I have a WiFi network in my house.  Installation is simple and takes maybe 3mins.\\n\\nThe rumble only works on games which have forced feedback software. This is totally understandable.  The feedback in NFS-MW is very slight but that's not the controllers fault, it's a matter of programming by EA Games.\\n\\nI like the weight of the controller.  It's not feather light, so with that motor and battery weight added, it feels more like a premium device (just like the 67$ with tax I paid for it - canadian dollars).  I didn't like how my gravis gamepad as so light, so this is a step up.\\n\\nThe analog sticks are a great for racing as they are progressive like a steering wheel.  They are rubber gripped for non-slip action.  I am used to the D-Pad, so I have mine setup in NFS to use both as a directional control without having to press the MODE button to switch because you don't have time during a race to press a button before switching.\\n\\nIt works as well as my old gamepad, but feels betetr and has extra buttons and the other features listed make it worth the money.  If you in the USA, you'll be getting a much better deal.  It lists for 60$ cnd here but only 30$ US in the states.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\nIt's not as comfortable to hold as I would like but its much better than my Gravis Gamepad and the buttons are easier to hit on the new one.\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\nI'm very satisfied overall and I knew I may have to get used to the way it feels when I hold this controller since changing from the old SNES style Gravis Gamepad.\\n\\n4/5 rating only because it could be easier to hold\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI work at a home office so I am on the phone lot.  I always buy cordless phones I can use with a headset so I can have both arms free while I talk with a min of background noise intrusion. In other words, I don't talk with the phone cradled between my shoulder and ear. And I don't use speaker phone features. Let's just get that out of the way now since those are things some have complained about that I couldn't care less about.\\n\\nThis phone first of all looks good and FEELS good. It was built with high quality plastics and metals on all surfaces. It has a nice solid weight to itself. Nothing tacky or cheap about it. It looks far better in person than it ever did in pictures. And it looks pretty good in pictures. I like how the bases are designed such that the antennas serve a double purpose as cradle supports for when the phone is docked. Clever design. The charging base light and back-lit buttons all look very slick.\\n\\nThe screen is attractive. A big step up from back-lit LCDs or no screen at all like my previous phone.\\n\\nI like that you can very quickly find and hit Mute, adjust volume, and page through your caller history.\\n\\nThe belt clip goes deep so the phone stays snugly attached to you pocket when you are walking around.\\n\\nI know many 5.8 GHz phones don't mention that only one direction of communication is at that frequency vs. both directions (as 2.4 GHz sometimes gets used too). I don't know for sure if this phone falls into that category, but I was in the market for a 5.8 GHz phone to avoid interference with my WiFi networks as well as to avoid microwave oven interference with my calls.  One thing's for sure: this phone definitely is immune from MY microwave oven. In the past when I was on a call heating up my coffee, static and voice quality went way down unless I got far away from the oven. With this new phone I can stand right by it while on High w/o ANY impact on voice quality.\\n\\nOne other very cool feature is the spare battery charger. While it's nice that the battery can replace a unit that runs down in a handset right away, the best part is if you have a power failure. Your phone will keep truckin' and there is never a need to replace that battery with some short lived 9volt waste of time.\\n\\nFinally, I like how the phone by a bedside basically doubles as a digital clock. The phone base unit picks up the current time from the caller ID info provided by the phone company and uses that info to automatically set and broadcast the current time to all headsets and base station. No need to manually set the clock. And when not in use, sitting it is dock, the phone's screen displays the time.\\n\\nSo far I've found the voice quality to be best of any cordless phone I've owned\\n</review_text>,\n",

Basically I love the concept of the Polycom Communicator!  When I first started using Skype I used a USB headset that works great.  The problem is that it is a serious PITA to put the thing on when someone calls because I have to either a. Try to untangle the cord before accepting the skype connection, or b. answer the skype connection then try to untangle the cord.  If I chose option a. envariably I would miss half the calls, if I chose option b. everyone would always comment that I sounded so desheveled when I tried to answer the call.  Well, now with the new Polycom communicator all I have to do is answer the call.\\n\\nAs far as the quality and performance of the Polycom communicator...that is the only reason I didn't give the item 4 stars.  It seems ocasionally that when you are in large conference calls that the Polycom communicator will cause feedback to other peoples lines.  It is really sporadic though, and I can't seem to reproduce it consistently.  Also, the driver for the Polycom Communicator has crashed on me a couple of times.\\n\\nSo despite the downfalls that I mentioned above, there is no way I could give up my Polycom Communicator now.

I don't know what the \"feet\" of the base is made of, but it is basically like a rubber version of a lead blanket - it is heavy yet is very pliable.  This is useful since my dash (a 2004 F-250) has an uneven surface.  I can press and mold the feet to put the base in a certain position and under most circumstances it'll stay there.  Occasionally, on long or \"bouncy\" trips, it'll creep out of position a couple inches and I'll have to move it back.  I've seen some comments complaining of that - but I don't see it as a problem since common sense says it won't stay perfectly still since it isn't bolted in place.  Overall this mount has worked very well.\\n\\nMy wife is going on a business trip next week and will be borrowing the GPS - I don't recommend she take the mount though - since the thing must way at least a couple pounds - too bulky and heavy to put in a suit case in my opinion\\n</review_text>,\n",

However, it kept slipping off the surface of my Toyota Avalon until I found a little sticky pad to put it on.  That solved that problem.

       " <review_text>\\nLet's just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years. My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano. It is easy to use, but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD's, the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow. The sound quality is good. I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader. I didn't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I'm sure 1000 songs will hold me. \\n\\nI looked all over at prices and Amazon wins! The free shipping is a great bonus also.\\n\\nThe case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me, I have had it in my pocket and it is just fine. Would highly recommend this MP3. It is cute to boot! This not so young person thinks it is WAY COOL\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot. I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sanso. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them. \\nI got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected! \\nI really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. \\nI also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs. \\nPeople are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips!\\nI think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sanso. This new nano is a must have!\\n</review_text>,\n",

I wasn't expecting as good or better quality than I can already get, but I hoped the Samson C01B USB Studio Condenser would at least give me a decent sound.  The idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits.  I was not disappointed.  Installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a USB port on my laptop running XP and the other end into the mic.  It is far from the best mic I have, but it is certainly not the worst.  I have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin, but I found that not to be the case.  The noise floor when recording with the Samson is a little high, and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my Millenia preamp.   I have to record at slightly lower levels than I am used to, but for $79, I am not complaining.  There is no significant latency recording 16 bits at 44100hz in Fasoft N-Track Studio.

       " <review_text>\\nThe 6500B was the last one I tried of three.  I've had cordless Panasonic phones break too often in the past so was reluctant to buy one again.  But the other choices had major drawbacks.  I really needed a two-line phone that wasn't 2.4Ghz.\\n\\nThe first I tried was the Uniden TRU8866.  It had a bad echo on the extra handset and other people complained about that too.  This phone uses phone company voice mail (no built-in ans mach) - which is fine - but I had the VM system go bonkers so lost all trust in it.  For over a week messages accumulated but we got no stutter-tone so didn't know there were any new messages - arrgghh.  Not the phones fault I know but it required VM for messaging so nope. \\n\\nNext I tried the new Motorola MD7081.  I really wanted to like this phone. It's a 2-line 5.8Ghz ans machine like the Panasonic 6500B.  I liked it's simplicity and easy switching between line 1 and 2.  Had battery backup for use during power outages and the best voice quality of the three.  But, it's answering system has no message counter.  That alone is no big deal but it didn't have any indicator to say whether you had any saved messages.  When a new message arrived it blinked and such - all good.  But, if I got home, say, and listened to a message for my wife, the blinking stopped and no indication of \"1 saved message\" or anything.  So, I would have to write a note to her to check the messages.  We're so used to relying on seeing a message counter and just listening to them if it's not zero that we thought this would become a nuisance.  I also would have liked an auto-line-selection so it would automatically answer the ringing line or select a non-busy outgoing line.  But, that would have messed up their simpler style button function - hmmm.\\n\\nThe Panasonic, I am surprised to say, ended up being my favorite.  Hopefully it will be reliable.  I was always bothered by Panasonic's phones losing the date/time with any little power outage.  Happily, this phone sets its date/time from caller-id info even though the manual implies it wouldn't work quite that way.  With the right settings and phone company options (busy-forward), it elegantly supports two lines as if they are one.  I really like not thinking about which line is what - just pick up and talk.\\n\\nThe 6500B has good voice quality and reasonable range.  It's much lighter than earlier caller-id handsets which I like.  I also like their shape of handset the best.  My gripes are the limit of 4 handsets - I would like 6 or 7.  Also, can't name the handsets so with intercom you have to remember each number\\n</review_text>,\n",

Don't underestimate this, if you use the net at a library or cafe then you'll realize that 1. not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2. you've got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port, which gets annoying quickly. when you clean out your purse and discover you don't have it with you. With this you get both in one. It has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems, even win98. The sound quality is good, I can't tell the difference between this and my $100.00 player. The controls do take a few seconds to get used to, but once I did I find I preferred them. They are easy to use one-handed.\\n\\nAn unexpected bonus is that its great for audiobooks! If you turn off the player, it starts back up exactly where you left it, be it in the middle of a song or in the middle of a chapter! Its small without being too tiny, its design is simple enough that there is nothing to fall off or get lost and technophobes won't have a heart-attack. Its doesn't hold a lot of music at only 128mb or have a shuffle feature, but if you need to carry more than an album or 2, or need extra features then you'll want more than this player anyway. \\n\\nThe best feature is the price. I found this one at my local ToysRUs for $15.00. It also plays both mp3's and wma. It won't play AAC but if most of your music is this format you'll better off with an ipod.\\n\\nThis would make a good first player for a kid or for someone who needs a usb drive and music without all the bells and whistles. \\n\\nI'm giving it 5 stars because it does exactly what I need it to do without any hassle\\n</review_text>,\n",

These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.\\n\\nI truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs\\n</review_text>,\n",

I did not purchase the plan, but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.\\n\\nSome notes on the contract:\\n1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\\n2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\\n3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\\n4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\\n5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\\n6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\\n\\nSo, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don't hold me liable since I don't have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.\\n\\nAssuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy).

       " <review_text>\\nThe V200 is another great Logitech product. It is far from the king of the mouse, but when it comes to the notebook it doesn't get much better than this. It takes two AA batteries (so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots. The mouse doesn't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves. This is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel. With the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do. Overall the design is good. There could be a problem installing setpoint. It may hang on install. If so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again. It should work. The USB receiver is 2.4 GHz and has a 10 Meter range. Wow. However there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook. USB dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off. For this reason you should have the USB receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand, if you can, to avoid accidental contact. It should also not be hanging over the edge of the table. If you press it down lightly, then that is it, game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 GHz receiver. So okay you will have to spend on a new receiver, if you break the old one. The receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet. When it is in the holder the mouse turns off. It doesn't fit in smoothly. It creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse. Anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in. The other thing is that it can pop out sometimes. Just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way. I am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices. If you are then a mouse like this and USB should last for a very long time. There is really nothing wrong with it. Wireless mini mouse. FAB! However there is one last thing to say. If you don't like the idea of a USB receiver then GET A BLUETOOTH VERSION OF THIS MOUSE INSTEAD. It is called the V270. That is if your notebook has internal Bluetooth or else you will need to get a Bluetooth USB receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your USB receivers. But if you have a Bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the V270 and forget about this USB option. The USB design isn't a fault with the mouse; it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault. You just got to switch to internal Bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers.\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nFirst and foremost--I am not an audiophile, so I can't comment with any authority on the quality of the headphones themselves.  They are fine for me and my listening habits--I find myself increasingly listening to podcasts when commuting via bus for which these headphones are perfectly fine, although when I do listen to my music the bass and treble response seems fine to me.\\n\\nThat being said, what I wanted was a convenient way to carry my 2G Nano so I could listen and manipulate the controls with the iPod handy yet out of the way.  This lanyard does an excellent job of providing that and I would recommend it to anyone.\\n\\nSo why four stars?  Well, for a few reasons:\\n\\n--Only available in white.  I have a black 2G 8GB Nano.  I'd have liked to match it.\\n\\n--No lock or release on the base that connects to the Nano.  While the connector does fit snug with the Nano and doesn't disconnect so easily from the Nano that I'd fear it might fall off while walking about, I would have felt more secure with some sort of lock or release mechanism holding it in place.\\n\\nFor this reason I would not recommend the lanyard to anyone doing any sort of strenuous activity or exercise--but hanging loose around the neck really isn't the best place for the Nano then anyway.  The armband would be more appropriate.\\n\\n--NOWHERE on the packaging did it say this was for the 2G Nano!  I had bought a 1G Nano lanyard at a local store and had to return it when I discovered it was incompatible (the dock connector and headphone jack on the 1G and 2G Nanos are NOT the same distance apart).  When this 2G lanyard arrived, I could find nothing on the package that said \"for 2G Nano\", so I opened it very gingerly thinking I had received the wrong lanyard and would need to repackage it and send it back.  I was very relieved when it did fit!  Regardless, there should be a very clear \"For 2G Nanos only!\" label on the box to alleviate 2G Nano owners' fears and to warn 1G Nano owners.\\n\\nAll in all, I am very happy with the lanyard.  It keeps the Nano handy while leaving my hands free, and that was what I was looking for\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nThe Sennheiser HD600s have only one thing wrong with them: they'll change you from someone who enjoys good audio... into an audiophile! I've been known as a videophile for many years over on one of the top AV forums, but I've always been satisfied with merely \"decent\" audio.  Until now.\\n\\nI'd previously ripped all my CDs into the (previously quite impressive) Windows Media format at 192K bps, but that's now useless.  With the phenomenal ability of the Sennheiser HD600s to reveal all the subtle nuances of your music, listening to compressed discs is like listening to your music through a thick layer of vaseline.  Here we go again... it's time to rip everything into lossless format.\\n\\nI cannot recommend these headphones more highly - they are simply extraordinary.  When your tastes become accustomed to this level of quality, though, life's going to get a lot more expensive, as you try to update everything to match your new level of sonic differentiation.\\n\\nStill, this is a bloody miracle.  My ears have finally been opened.  Wow\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nHaving been a buyer of Sennheiser products for over 10 years, I feel it is time I endorse a product I truly believe in, and have never been let down by. Including service and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nEach time buying a Sennheiser product, I found myself stepping up to the next level of their headphones, because they simply keep improving their technology to the point that what you used to own by them gets overwhelmed by the latest headphone they offer. When I bought the HD-600's, I had just come away from years owning the HD-25. When these encountered a technical problem, I replaced them with a backup choice, the HD-25SP's. The difference in sound going 'lower' down their scale of products was just too much to bear. So I bit the bullet and went higher. \\n\\nWhether you use Sennheiser's merely for pleasure, or for studio work, the accuracy of their sound, and what you get for your money cannot be beat. My HD-600's ran into a small technical glitch (and Sennheiser were extremely helpful in getting this fixed and replaced within 2 days of receipt), and I swear I nearly cried in their absence. HD-600's give you a clear idea of how things were recorded, how good your system is, and what truly sounds inferior. You never listen to things quite the same way again.\\n\\nThe reason my reviews of Paul McCartney and John Lennon albums from the 70's all comment on how inferior the recording quality is (especially compared to the so called ''Economy Class Beatles'' George Harrison's and Ringo Starr's albums from the same decade), is down to what HD-600's reveal. My main source of media tends to be Vinyl, because Compact Discs and DVD's still cannot capture what analogue/turntable equipment captures. Vinyl is simply warmer and more 'round' in comparison to its digital counterparts. And when listening to badly recorded albums, HD-600's make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio. HD-600's are the reason I mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying Lennon and McCartney solo albums. Listening to ''Take IT Away'' from 1982's Tug Of War reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield. Which sounds much like someone forgot to 'silence' a track that had a recording on it, before the instrument actually showed up in the song. It sounds totally like electrical / amp noise coming from equipment, and Geoff Emerick or George Martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song. \\n\\nIt gets much worse than 'Take It Away' on Paul McCartney albums, and even more painfully so on John Lennon albums. But listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums BACK TO THE EGG, RAM, DOUBLE FANTASY, MILK AND HONEY, and some portions of BAND ON THE RUN, and WALLS AND BRIDGES. #9 Dream is simply a gorgeous recording, it's just too bad the rest of the album doesn't sound as good as that one song.\\n\\nWhen you listen to your CD's, vinyl, DVD's in whatever room of your house your speakers are, the room dictates what you hear, no matter what you've spent on speakers, power amps, woofers, sub-dividers, etc. Whether you have wall to wall carpeting, high ceilings, low ceilings, plaster or cement, wood floors, a more long than wide room, it all affects how sound reaches your ear. Which is why on a great set of headphones, you are more likely to hear HOW those sounds were meant to be heard, how they were recorded, and how much time was spent doing it. On speakers, McCartney's JET sounds quite full, though the snare is a little thin. But when hearing the album with HD-600's, the drums nearly become non-existent, and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent, you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone. McCartney on drums is not a miracle, especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on Bass. \\n\\nCan I review anything without bringing up Lennon and McCartney? Quite possibly Dog Food. But so far, they come up pretty regularly. Makes you wonder if I'm trying to prove a point doesn't it.\\n\\nAlbums that are phenomenally recorded get due justice with Sennhesier HD-600's. They truly do. Some noteworthy recordings from the 70's and 80's when recording technology (for popular music) was just beginning to reach new highs, that are all HD-600 friendly:\\n\\nIsao Tomita's The Firebird (1976)\\nGeorge Harrison's eponymous album (1979)\\nSteely Dan's Gaucho (1980)\\nJoe Walsh's The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get (1973)\\n10CC's The Original Soundtrack (1975)\\nGodley &amp; Creme's Consequences (1977)\\nSupertramp's Crime of the Century (1974)\\nXTC's Black Sea (1980)\\nPeter Gabriel's 3rd album (1980)\\nKate Bush's The Dreaming (1982)\\nEarth Wind and Fire's All 'n' All (1977)\\nLevel 42's The Pursuit of Accidents (1982)\\nBilly Cobham's Spectrum (1972)\\nFrank Zappa's One Size Fits All (1975)\\nRingo Starr's Goodnight Vienna (1974)\\n\\nand a truly incredible sounding album from the 90's, Prince and The New Power Generation's ''Symbol'' album from 1992.\\n\\nAlbums NOT HD-600 friendly:\\nTodd Rundgren's Hermit of Mink Hollow (1978)\\nBlue Oyster Cult's Agents of Fortune (1976)\\nPaul McCartney's Venus and Mars (1975 - and quite a few others)\\nJohn Lennon's Imagine (1971 - and avoid 1970's Instant Karma like the plague, the piano track will hurt you . .  )\\nYes's Fragile (often the guitars and keyboards hit frequencies that cause a lot of crackling and clipping)\\n\\nand surprisingly enough, many remasters of albums once on vinyl or antiquated CD reveal the errors of fixing something that ain't broken.  \\n\\n\\nIf you have to save up for a pair, or do some heavy searching for HD-600's that are affordable, do so. In over 10 years I have never been disappointed by anything Sennheiser distributed, especially when I kept up with their pace.\\n\\n\\n\\n</review_text>,\n",

It you record in full quality mode (1.25 hours with built in 32meg memory) and listen to it again with good headphones it does sound amazing. The Voice Up (so you hear each person in a conversation) works very well as do other nice features.\\n\\nBut it is let down with the software supplied not performing MP3 conversion. Going to .wav then .mp3 with another program is a pain and simply converting to .wav to get away from proprietary .msv takes up too much space.\\n\\nBut I would buy one again, as it is very easy to use, small, and very high quality.

       " <review_text>\\nBefore I bought this device, I was trying to enjoy the \"Hearts of Space\" website, \"This American Life\" and other NPR shows available for online streaming.  Only problem was, I didn't like being shackled to my computer in order to hear them.   I did some research on the internet, read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the Logitech Wireless Music System.  I would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here.\\n\\nIt was indeed quite fast and easy to set up.  No lengthy manuals to read (thank goodness.)  I did not find it necessary to load the CD software that came with the device.  If I want to listen through the stereo, I plug in the USB.  If I want to listen through the computer, I simply unplug the USB.  It's very simple.\\n\\nI am 100% satisfied with the sound quality.  I would not be able to tell the difference between FM radio and the online streaming.  However, I do have to turn up my stereo about twice as loud when I am sending internet audio streams to it using this device, than when I am listening to a CD or the radio.  On my stereo (which isn't fancy), this does not cause diminished sound quality, so I'm perfectly OK with it.  I just have to remember to turn down the volume before switching back to CD or radio listening.\\n\\nIf you are wondering whether the device will be compatible with your stereo, check for two things.  First, your stereo has to have a set of two holes side-by-side that are for the twin plugs generally colored white and red.  I'm sorry I do not know the technical names for these things, but there's a picture of the red-and-white plugs on this Amazon page in the Manufacturer's \"Product Description\" section (just scroll up until you see it.)  Second, your stereo has to have a button that will let you switch to \"Auxiliary\" input.  My stereo has this, but my portable CD player/cassette player/radio (AKA boom box) does not.   If it is important to you to be able to use this on a portable player you can carry around the house and/or outside, be sure to check your player for these two things.\\n\\nOverall I am very satisfied and quite happy with the product\\n</review_text>,\n",

When it doesn't work, it is erratic and locks up. Turn it on and off and while the LED will light up, it will still not work well. This is the hint that the battery is low. The mouse comes with two rechargable NiMH AAA batteries. These are 650mAh batteries and are not the best. I bought 4 1000mAh AccuPower NiMH batteries. I keep 2 in the charger.

       " <review_text>\\nI was looking for something suitable to house my sansa, and this fit the bill better than most. The leather case is superb, looking sharp, snug and protective. I enjoy the fact you can still easily access the buttons and menus through it. Both the leather case and the larger case have an atachee on the back, if you wished to connect them to the cord that comes with it. The cleaning cloth works as well as any lense cloth, great for cleaning. The screen protector is a pain in the rear to apply without bubbles, still haven't figured out how yet, and I may trim it to make it more visually appealing. But, really, if you invest in a product such as this, it really makes sense to protect the easily scratched screen! The larger case is compact and protective, having a small storage area, yet the cover is a bit unsightly because of the cheap, generic looking Sansa logo. Only other complaint is that the leather case goes on a belt, but not as a removable type. Only if you put it on when putting on the belt, which can be impractical in some circumstances. This way, I suppose, it wouldn't be able to fall off\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nWe purchased the YSP-1 in August as a companion to our Hitachi Ultravision wall-mounted television.  What a fabulous piece of audio equipment!\\n\\nWhen we began searching for a replacement for our Infiniti surround system, my husband and I had different concerns.  He is an audiophile that demands wide range digital sound with full depth of field and I was ready for aestethic simplicity (no speakers throughout the room and wires everywhere).  When we found the YSP-1 we thought it was too good to be true.  One speaker instead of five?  Wall-mounted?  Doesn't take up any floor space?  We visited two Yamaha dealers to see it for ourselves.  One had the YSP-1 set up in a room environment.  The other, on the salesroom floor.  In both set-ups it performed consistantly.  In both demonstrations however, my husband felt the low-end sound could use enhancement.  So, we made the purchase and opted to use the YSP-1 with our existing subwoofer.  Installation was fairly simple, provided you have the necessary tools.  The most important, and time-consuming part was leveling and centering the speaker under the television.  Now that it is installed and in use in our home, I feel the low-end sound is quite adequate and prefer not to use the sub-woofer.  My husband though, prefers the earth-shaking action sequences in movies to mimic their intended theatre quality sound.  More than movies the sound quality you get when listening to CDs is absolutely stunning.  Overall, we both got what we wanted.  Expert sound designation and sleek, minimalistic styling (with the added bonus of more floor and wall space). \\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nOnce THE speaker of choice for every hard rockin' audiophile with a big enough garage, Klipsch fell off the landscape for a while after being sold to a corporate conglomerate that didn't know the real value of what they'd bought.  But after another buyout by a small group of genuine audiophiles, Klipsch is back on top, from a sound quality standpoint -- and it shows in the ProMedia 2.1 THX.\\n\\nI have my trio connected to a new Mac Pro desktop unit and the sound is absolutely magical.  Yes, there are more complex set-ups, with 5 or 7 speakers spread out across the room, but if you just want the magic without the madness, the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX is an incredible (and very affordable) solution that's quick and easy to configure in about 5 minutes.\\n\\nOf course, there are other 3-speaker desktop systems by makers like Logitech, Cyber Acoustics, and Intec, but here's the difference: Klipsch is a true speaker company that connects great speakers to your computer, while those others are computer peripherals companies that one day decided to make speakers.  NOT the same thing.  The only brands that are true competitors to Klipsch in this area are Bose, Harman Kardon, JBL, and Altec Lansing.  I find that the Altec Lansing and JBL 3-speaker sets both sound nasal and \"tinny\" on the high end, while the Bose and Harman Kardon sets sound great, but are more expensive.

I experienced the same thing until I realized that I mistaken the up &amp; down buttons with the + &amp; - buttons.  The volume works just fine on my wife's old Sony receiver.  The remote is quite nice and it does everything the iPod control could do.  As stated in others' reviews, you can't read the screen from a distance, thus rendering the ability to scroll through the menu with the remote a bit pointless.  However, it would be worse if the remote couldn't scroll through menus.\\n\\nIt is compatible with the latest video iPod.  I have the 60 gig iPod but I do notice a slight hiss coming out from the speakers.  I listen to classical music and the hiss bothers me.  I bought this for my wife and she is not as picky as I am in terms of sound quality.  Then again, I don't expect high fidelity quality from this small setup.  Since I have this little gadget for my wife, I bought the Squeezebox for myself from Slim Devices to stream music which sounds a lot better.\\n\\nIn summary, this dock does a good job and the design is not bad.  The construction is solid and I like the light on the remote.  If you are looking for great sound quality, I haven't encountered any dock that is better than this one, so this might be your best bet.  The Apple A/V cables work fine as well but it is more expensive than the dock and I see more value in this dock\\n</review_text>,\n",

No biggies, though, since setting up is really easy. Basically all you have to do is open the SetPoint software that was installed with the driver, point to the intended buttons that you want to program, and assign a corresponding keystroke to it. In this case, it's Alt+Right for forward button and Alt+Left for back button. Click \"Apply\" and you're good to go a-browsin'!!\\n\\nBattery life so far is really good - it's been going on the same set of Duracell AA batteries since I got it 3 months ago, and still going strong. \\n\\nThe RF range is really good, although admittedly my room isn't big enough to really put its range to the test. Dorm-dweller users should be happy with the range, though. You could just lie on your bed and only lift one finger to control your music or movie.\\n\\nThis mouse is also great looking; not cheap-plasticky but actually sharp and slick. It does feel a bit odd to the grip when using as a remote control, but as a mouse it's really sturdy and ergonomic. \\n\\nI can't comment on installation since it's been a while since I first used it, but I guess no impression is good impression - if it was troublesome I'm sure I'd remember.\\n\\nI'd second the other reviewer's gripe about how most cordless keyboards come with a mouse, and this fantastic mouse doesn't come with a cordless keyboard...

       " <review_text>\\nI received it today, and it's a monster.  If you've seen one in a store, it looks twice as big on your desk.  Until a few hours ago, I was running two 20\" aluminum cinema displays on a PNY 6600GT.  After doing online research about using the 30\" display under Windows XP, I found that the \"functional\" cheap solution being used is in fact the PNY 6600GT (Verto 128MB DDR3 with two DVI connectors).  Considering that the other two most noted solutions, QuadroFX 4000 AGP or Parhelia DL256 PCI, are going for $600+ on ebay, I was willing to give my old beater a try.  Besides, I didn't feel like buying another AGP card with PCIE taking over the world, or sacrificing the only PCI slot in my Shuttle XPC (SB75G2).\\n\\nTo my great relief, the monitor worked on the card right away, even showing me the POST and Windows start-up screen (it did for the 20\" displays, too).  But to my absolute delight, the card is actually running both the 30\" and a 20\" in 32-bit color.  The 20\" looks absurdly small next to the 30\", like I didn't water it enough or something.  The 30\" is enormous enough that I think it might be better were it curved!  Maybe I'm just sitting too close.\\n\\nThe only problem with the 6600GT is that the DVI jacks are so near each other that I had to take the plastic housing off of the 20\" plug to fit it below the 30\".  I'm not a gamer, so I can't say whether the card performs well for that.  It feels as zippy as with the 20\" on regular windowing tasks.  I use Eclipse, Flash, Photoshop, etc., but no video editing or 3D stuff.\\n\\nThe screen had a slight warm cast that I didn't like.  Nvidia's control panel let me adjust it manually, and now my 30\" and 20\" look almost identical.  My biggest fear was of course dead pixels.  By the good grace of lucky ducks, this is the third panel I've gotten from Apple with no dead pixels.  Brightness is uniform but for a very very subtle drop in the far lower left and right edges.  It's not apparent unless you put white there and actively look for it.\\n\\nIn any case, I bought it to get more programming panels on the screen at once, and it does a fine job at that.  I'm using the 20\" for browsing and, alas, a few panels that STILL don't fit.  Apple, where's 3840 x 2400??  I strip one star cuz it's crazy expensive.\\n</review_text>,\n",

So when I got my new reciever (Sony STR-DE898/B) I hooked up the new speaker wires with the THX Certified Gold Plated speaker connectors and wow what a difference. I miscalculated how much wire I needed so my rear right speaker does not have the new speaker wire, I can hear a light and day difference in sound quality. Needless to say I'm ordering more to complete the job. The monster fiber optic cable is a must as well. I can hear sounds that I normally couldn't on my old system. I like testing sound with: The Hulk (the scene were he tears up the tanks), Saving Private Ryan (taking the beach), and Open Range (Gunfight at the end of the movie). In all these movies there are small sounds that you can distinctly hear now that I could not before the new wire and connectors. Excellent product\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nThis is my first mp3 player so I researched it carefully before making my decision. The gorgeous screen, the wide number of codecs it supports and the 30gb hard drive were all selling points. I'm so glad I bought it. Videos look great on the screen. Some need to be converted over which is a slow process but in general I love it. The built in speaker doesn't do it justice. Even on the included earbuds the sounds quality is amazing. Making playlists with the creative software is very easy. My biggest problem is the lag of accessories for it. No case, no screen protectors out for it. I'd love to see a docking station that lets you record to it as a dvr the way the archos players do. But for the money it looks to me to be a far superior player to the Ipod or the Zune.\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI did a lot of research on Amazon.com before I finally decided on this mouse.  I wanted to replace my (extremely) small Kensington USB mouse with a retractable cable.  At home, I use a Wacom tablet.  Next month I am traveling abroad, so I wanted a slightly bigger mouse that can handle more frequent use than the Kensington.  Wireless was key for portability.  I also wanted something rechargeable, and I didn't want the USB adapter sticking out.\\n\\nI received it today, and I'm on my first charge.  So no comments on batteries (which can be replaced with other AAA NiMH for optimal performance if desired anyway).\\n\\n- I have large but skinny hands.  Mouse is small, but its long length helps in terms of where to place your fingers.  Of course convenience is not comparable to a full-size mouse, but if you want portability, this is about the right size.\\n\\n- I have a PowerBook that runs Tiger (10.4).  Excellent Bluetooth connection.  Also very good response, very little delay.  Only reservation is for the scroll wheel, which requires subtle pressure for accurate scrolling - this is ever so slightly uncomfortable if you have large hands, because the mouse is flat and your hand is adjusted over the mouse so that it is a bit hard to apply adequate vertical pressure on the scroll wheel from that position.  It is hard to explain, but not a big issue for me. \\n\\n- USB charger works well.  The added size of the USB adapter helps with comfortability (still flat, but becomes an otherwise full-sized mouse) - despite the fact that the cable attaches to the bottom of the mouse.\\n\\n- As mentioned by others, installing the batteries is a challenge.  Pull the notch on the bottom of the mouse as you slide the top (part with the Anycom label) away from the clickers.  Once I figured it out, not so hard. \\n\\nOverall, I don't seek perfection anyway, so this mouse does the job adequately for me.  I haven't tried any other Bluetooth mouse before, so I'm more or less in awe\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nThis card has been working great for me so far after over a month of heavy use.  \\n\\n512 MB is more than enough space for anyone with a 5 MB or less camera, assuming you transfer photos off your camera fairly regularly and are not shooting hundreds of photos at a time.  With the 1200x1600p setting I use on my camera most often, this card holds over 400 photos, and it will hold even more for those using a more email-friendly setting.

       " <review_text>\\nI have to admit, I'm a GPS junkie.  I've had a variety of GPS units over the past decade and currently own 3 - the c340 being my latest acquisition for use solely when driving.\\n\\nI am greatly impressed with this unit.  It was fast to get going right out of the box and after the initial satellite acquisition and almanac download (for those who are interested, when a GPS unit is turned off and moved a significant distance, say 300+ miles, from where it last thought it was, it needs to recalibrate itself by downloading the current almanac of satellite positions from the GPS satellites.  This can take a few minutes.) In any case, after the initial automatic recalibration, the unit acquired satellites quickly whenever I turned it on.\\n\\nThe user interface is very easy to use.  I've used Hertz NeverLost systems for years and have always thought they had a good interface.  I think Garmin's is better.\\n\\nOne highly useful feature is the ability not just to search for Points of Interest (POI), but to have the unit search for those points of interest that are along the route you are currently navigating.  This allows you to identify, say, hotels along your route while you are driving and then, using the telephone info provided by the unit, to call the hotels up and see if you can negotiate a lower rate before you arrive - \"let your fingers do the walking...\"\\n\\nIf you don't tell the unit where to look, though, it can take quite a while to search for a Point of Interest.  I didn't know which city to specify and I did a search for \"Eagle Rock Rec\" (I was too lazy to spell out \"Eagle Rock Recreation Center\" which turned out to be about 175 miles away) and the unit chugged away for several minutes but eventually came back with the right entry for me to navigate to.  I later realized that even though I didn't know the exact city the destination was in, I did know a city that was near the desired destination.  When I specified that information, the c340 took only a few seconds to find the right location.\\n\\nThe advanced user can also create your own POI lists complete with custom icons and load those into the c340.  I have done this for all In-N-Out Burger and Krispy Kreme locations.  The advantage to having your own custom POIs even though these places are in the built-in POI list is that the custom POIs are visible on the c340 map screen at certain zoom levels.  If you are a Geocacher, you can do the same with geocaches, but you'll still need your handheld unit to find the cache.\\n\\nThe newer (and more expensive) c5xx units evidently have the Sirf circuitry in them which is more sensitive, allowing signal acquisition indoors, but I found the sensitivity of the c340 to be fine - especially since I have limited my indoor driving lately :-). I haven't tried the c340 under a thick tree canopy with cloud cover yet, so I might change my tune.  The comparable c5xx unit at this price point, the c530, lacks the c340's text-to-speech capabilities (this prevents the c530 from announcing street names).\\n\\nSince I already have a Garmin handheld GPS unit as well as Garmin's MapSource Topo mapping software, I used the unlock code that came with the c340 to unlock my MapSource maps for the unit. I then loaded the topo maps for the entire Western US onto an SD card (between 300-500 MB) and plugged it into the c340 to see what would happen.  It worked!  So now I have the c340's excellent built-in maps and POIs for on-road trips *and* Topo Maps available to me for off-road adventures.\\n\\nOne thing you should do if you are in the US is enable the unit's WAAS capability (the default is for WAAS to be disabled).  Enabling this capability increases the accuracy of the unit when certain satellites are in range.\\n\\nAlso, since this unit has a touch-screen, fingerprints on the screen are inevitable. You should *never* use an ammonia-based product (like most window cleaners) to clean electronic screens - it will cause them to fog.  Instead, use those little antiseptic alcohol towelettes.  They are cheap and if you don't use them for cleaning your touch-screen they might come in handy for first-aid.\\n\\nI give this unit a highly positive rating.  I like it\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nThere's no need to take anybody else's word for specs on this Sony DVD player when you can view or download, for free, the user's manual at http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-documents.pl?mdl=DVPNS90V&amp;LOC=3. I've been running this Sony DVP-NS90V player through a Sony widescreen HDTV and a Pioneer amplifier/receiver for several days now, and I find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers. One, for example, states that there is \"no bass management,\" yet you can (a) route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting \"small\" or \"large\" for the front speaker size (see page 76 of the user's manual), and also (b) increase or decrease the bass from -15 dB to +5 dB (see page 77 of the manual). Whether you prefer analog to digital audio, or you think SACD's are tops, is a matter of opinion, taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit. I, for one, prefer DVD-Audio, and I mention this for an important reason: Some product ads and the user's manual clearly warn that this unit \"will NOT play DVD-Audio discs.\" Happy surprize: it most certainly will! For my DVD-A's that have optional Dolby 5.1 and/or DTS tracks, the player simply ignores the primary DVD-A format (normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors) but still plays the Dolby or the DTS via the digital audio (optical or coaxial) connectors. For \"pure\" DVD-A's (without Dolby 5.1 or DTS tracks), it conveniently outputs the audio BOTH via the 6 analog AND the digital connectors. And in all cases above, the audio is full multi-channel surround, and not downmixed to 2-channel PCM, nor Prologic pseudo-surround. The only DVD-A function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on DVD-A's, and so displays only the \"jacket image\" onscreen. The Quick Setup allows any DVD newbie to be up and running in a short time. And the Custom Setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and trouble-shooters that it's bound to please even the high-end audio-video geek-freaks. In short, you'll find this to be a superior universal player, provided you read the user's manual (all 84 pages of it!), follow it, and connect equally high-quality, compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI've had my Epson 1280 for over two years now and consider it money well spent. I run exclusively on Linux (currently Gentoo) and the Linux support for this printer (using CUPS) is superb. All modes, resolutions, etc. are supported. I use this printer a lot for engineering work printing B-size (tabloid) drawings and it works great for that.\\n\\nLike just about every review states, this printer slurps ink like Homer Simpson slurps beer. Because I don't print many color photos this is not a problem for me--if I was doing that I'd get the Niagara system other reviewers cite. I've researched the Niagara system and  it looks like a good deal for heavy users. \\n\\nMy main complaint with this printer--and the reason why it only gets four stars--is the ease with which the heads clog up. This printer wants to be used constantly. If you let it sit for a day or two it's almost guaranteed that one or more of the jets will clog up and you'll get streaks in the output. Then you have to either press the front-panel control or, in more extreme cases, run the head-unclogging utility (on Linux I use mtink) to force the printer to 'blow out' the plugged jets. When the printer does this it blasts ink through the heads wasting even more of the pricey ink. Do this enough and the reservoir the printer blasts the ink into (a sponge-sandpaper-like thing) will overflow and cause the head to smear ink all over the paper. That's when you get out the Windex and paper towels and clean up the mess (google the web for details.) Because of this 'trait' I would not recommend this printer for casual users.\\n\\nStill, for B-sized printing and high-quality photos, and considering how well supported it is under Linux, there's not much else better out there\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nHaving owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far, I can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results. The drivers at least for Mac OS X are easy to understand and reliable. The ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing, is a vey nice touch as well. However, it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me. By using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings, one can get nice rich colors that are on cue. Thus this printer makes good for doing proofs. As an artist and Graphic Designer, having this quality is a blessing since this print cost $ 400 at the time of parchase. Compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from $2000 on up. Also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers. The only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer. Also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey. But what inkjet dosen't have that problem? Anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often. So any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it, the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job. So I'm giving 5 stars on the Epson 128\\n</review_text>,\n",

Originally, the DVI-D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal, but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion.  If you need a DVI-D cable, an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway.

       " <review_text>\\nEarlier this week I received the factory referbished Samsung HD841.  I have had a few days to use it and compare it to my other players, mainly my Philips 642, which have been excellent players for me. This Model does well.  I don't understand why this model has such a rough reveiw.  Note, this model has the DVI output, If your TV has an HDMI port, you will want to check out the Samsung HD 850 (identical otherwise).  First, this model has component, composite and S-video hook ups, as well as the DVI port (still have to run seperate sound out with DVI). Also, this model does feature digital coax sound out and optical sound out as well for systems that can handle 5.1 THX.  Many upconvert models do not have the digital outs on lower priced models. The picture quality is great, at 480p comparable with my Philips.  Again, The upconvert works well out the DVI hook up to my TV, but to be honest, it is hard to tell any difference between it and a good 480p progressive scan player, at least on my tv which is a 23\" 720p LCD.  Menus also are a bit difficult to figure out at first as well.  The user manual is less than impressive at explaining thing, in fact, it does not have an index.  But, it the main thing is that the player is does perform well, and is a name brand product from samsung (I have had some offbrand experience and have had perfomace problems).  THis player also appears to have DivX available on it, not noted in the product discription, so that was a suprise as well.  This will allow the use of MP4 movie files.  The remote again is bigger and at first more difficult than my other players, but after a day or so it actually is better because many of the features are available to change at the push of a button instread of going through the menus.  In all, I will continue to explore this new player, but in all it seems to be a quality product that has received some bad flack.  So give it a chane, the prices are good currently, quality has been good, and it is a Samsung.\\nNote to the technosavy: I have not had luck using the component upconvert code that is available on other web sites, so I am using my DVI input for upconvert.  Also, the new Blue ray (HD 1080p) DVD players are out, so if you have the expensive hi res tvs that can handle this, you might want to wait and save till you can get the new DVD players.  \\nNote 2: the factory referbished models come with a DVI cable, a 20-30 dollar value that many don't come with\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nBREAKING NEWS: If you are buying a new video playback capable iPod, please look for the new iPod Universal dock, which has s-Video output for both photos and video.  It is also ready to accept a control remote so you can control your iPod from your sofa.\\n\\nIs this expensive?  The answer is probably yes.  This dock was included on the original iPod Photo of late 2004 (priced $500-$600), the dock was removed as Apple lowered the prices this year to their current levels for color iPods.  However, for a couple of uses: high quality home audio and Slide Shows on hi-res TVs, it is a great alternative.\\n\\nThis dock basically serves three purposes:\\n- The traditional synch &amp; charge function available since the early days.\\n- It helps you get \"Line\" output out of an iPod.  Line output is a cleaner, higher quality sound output than the usual headphone output out of the miniplug jack.  It is the best way to connect your iPod to a home stereo or home theater.\\n- The super Video out for color iPods.  This function is something you cannot get without the dock.  So, if you like to show your pictures to your friends &amp; family using a hi-res TV (Plasma, LCD or a Flat Screen) this is a great tool to use.  As an alternative, if you do not want to use s-Video and are OK with regular digital video out, a cheaper alternative is the \"Apple iPod AV Cable\" at $19 from the Apple Store or similar alternatives.\\n\\nIn summary, buy this if you hook your iPod to high quality audio equipment or if you regularly do hi-res slide shows on your TV.  If you don't do it, it's just too expensive as a synch/charger, since anything you need is in the iPod box\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI'm very happy with this model. I use it mostly as a VCR replacement to record broadcast TV shows. You can't beat the price for this feature-set. I'll try to describe some aspects that aren't mentioned in the other reviews. The owner's manual can also be found online in PDF format.\\n\\nIt can schedule upto 16 programs. It does not support VCR+ or a TViO-style program guides. You can enter a title into each schedule that appears both on the schedule list and direct navigator chapter menus. It even sorts the main schedule listing and indicates which events are on the current disk. Every on-screen menu shows you which remote control buttons are functional on that screen.\\n\\nThe commercial skip button advances about 60 seconds which isn't quite granular enough, but 2 clicks and a little fast forwarding works well. The remote operations have a very fast feeling response compared to tape players. \\n\\nMy only complaint: The remote sensor on the recorder seems to be all the way on right-hand side. When the unit is in our video cabinet, the sensor is in a deadzone for half the room. We can't shift the position much because the disk tray slot is all the way on the left side and won't open if it's too close to the wall. Of course this probably means nothing to you.\\n\\nAt the highest quality setting (XP) it made a very good (near perfect I'd say) copy from a 8mm video camera using analog inputs. At that setting, only one hour of content fits on a DVD. The next lower setting (SP) which can hold two hours per disk, the copy from the video camera had some contrast problems. Most TV shows recorded in EP (8 hrs) are acceptable quality although you do see the blockiness and some motion blur at times. This is especially pronounced on animated shows. The four-hour LP setting had no apparent digital artifacts on recorded TV. It also has a Flex-mode option I haven't tried yet in which you tell it how long to record and it will fit the recording to the freespace available on the disk at the highest possible quality.  Probably would be good for recording a TV movie.\\n\\nIt's too bad other vendors haven't adopted the -RAM format because most of the features on this box only work on that kind of media, but it won't play on most other equipment. The other formats seem lame by comparison, but this unit can play and record on them. \\n\\nWatching one show while another is recording (or the same show that's recording, but from the beginning) is very easy to do. Most of the operations are very sensible and explained on-screen pretty well, but you should spend some time in the manual if you've never had a dvd recorder before. It can do a lot of stuff.\\n\\nOne interesting feature is that no matter what input you are using, the signal is sent through the s-video output.\\n\\nIt can't burn music CD's which seems like it would have been a trivially easy feature to add. That and a battery backup (so I won't lose my schedule) and wider angle of view for the remote sensor would required get the fifth review star\\n</review_text>,\n",

It does have trouble getting a signal downtown sometimes, when I am surrounded by tall buildings (Wacker Dr.)  But this is expected and can be corrected with the purchase of an external antenna.\\nOverall, this GPS works perfectly.

The sound is crystal clear and with a decent sound card all of the settings can be tweaked until perfection.  Setup was a breeze and no instructions are needed although they are provided just in case.\\n\\nSomething to note is the speaker wire that comes with the speakers is a little on the small size and thicker wires should be be purchased if you are picky about your sound.  The wires themselves are long enough and there shouldn't be any trouble reaching anywhere assuming you are putting these in a normal sized room.  One last thing to know is that there is no optical input for these speakers and only 1/8\" plugs for hooking up the sound source.  If you want optical you're going to have to go elsewhere.\\n\\nPlease note that buying these speakers will not make up for having a mediocre sound card or poor music quality.  If you are using most types of on board sound or an ancient soundblaster card it is time to upgrade or else you are just throwing away your money.  Same goes for music quality, if you are listening to an mp3 that is below 128kbps the poor sound quality is because of the shoddy encoding, not the speakers.  If you can't spare the hard drive space for 192kbps its time to get a new hard drive.\\n\\nOverall these speakers are a great deal.  While the price tag does seem a bit steep it is well worth the money for anyone that is serious about their music or movies.  For those of you who like to game these speakers will treat you good, however in my past experience a good set of headphones is better than a full blown sound system.  Lastly for those of you who like to play your music and bass full blast, don't bother spending the money.  These speakers should only be purchased by people who actually care about sound quality.  If you are more worried about loudness, do yourself a favor and buy some cheaper speakers, you won't even notice the difference\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI hadn't seen this product in stores as I usually would see the white TuneDok which seemed pretty cool but I decided to buy this one online to go better with my black car (I have a white 40GB 4th generation iPod).\\nThe holder is everything you would expect and it did work a little better than I expected. It's very easy to just place the iPod in the holder and very easy to take it off. You can do it with one hand. You just pull back the small tab of the suction thing on the back and your iPod is easily removed and ready to go. The additional cup adapters is an added bonus for those who need them, but the standard one was enough for me.\\n\\nThe part that is black and holds the iPod is what seems to be the best thing about the product. As far as I know the cups are the same grey color for both the white TuneCok and this black version, so the difference is only in the iPod holder and not the cups.\\n\\nThe only \"bad\" thing I could say is that the cup itself is made of a rubbery plastic that scratches easily. In fact when I was trying to figure out what the adapters were for (before reading the manual..oops), I scratched it quite a LOT trying to fit the two additional cups together. That doesn't affect functionality so it doesn't make me give it less than 5 stars. A small issue you might want to consider as well is that the TuneDok doesn't hold iPods in their cases. So if you're like me and carry your iPod everywhere in a case you might wan to consider having a case that is easy to put on the iPod and remove it to avoid the hassle everytime you want to place the iPod on the TuneDok.\\n\\nI like how the black TuneDok looks with my white iPod. It kind of makes the iPod stand out more than the TuneDok itself. I think the $15 price is pretty reasonable for the white TuneDok, and this one is too if you're willing to pay the extra $5 for it to go with your U2 iPod. But as I said, I think my white iPod looks cooler in my black car with the black TuneDok anyway.\\nEdit: I bought it for $20, but now it's $15. One more good reason to get this one.\\n\\nI'm not too sure, but it seems like the new 5G iPod fits in the TuneDok. If they do, I bet this product is going to turn into a top seller soon enough as the demand for the black iPods is greater than the white one.

       " <review_text>\\nI have owned many Sony cameras in the past and am currently using two right now. The only problem I have encountered with any digital camera is that when you think you have enough memory, you run out when you need it most. That is why I upgraded all of my cameras from 256 and 512 meg memory sticks to the Sony 1 gig. Actually I carry a spare 1 gig too where ever I go. \\n\\nLook, when you take video with your digital camera or you use a high file size (3-6 megapixels) per picture, which you should always do to get the best possible prints made, your camera will need a ton of storage space.  Especially if you are on vacation or encounter a great photo moment or maybe even something you hadn't expected like a wildfire, a plane crash, a bank robbery or maybe even a cat in the park having kittens. You can always \"resize\" you photos to a smaller size later when you save then to your computer if you want to save space. Trust me, take large megapixel pics now and you will be amazed at how many shots came out better that you expected.\\n\\nYou never know. I have tons of pictures that people ask how did I ever get such good pictures of such amazing things. I have a helicopter crash, police car up a power poll, deer in downtown Oakland, house fire before the Fire Dept got there, tons of wild animals, any many more things I saw while I was driving somewhere or walking in a park. If you want great photos you have to be prepared when the moment arrives!\\n\\nMatching a camera with its name brand memory is also a great idea. No problems ever!! The Sony memory sticks I have from 5 to 6 years ago still work great with no problems. They make it fast and easy to transfer data from your camera to your computer. They are tiny wafer thin and extremely light weight and durable. I have first hand knowledge that products with the SONY name on it are first rate and high quality. If you want quality buy SONY\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI've used the iTrip by Belkin, the TunecastII by Belkin, and this Monster iCarPlay for getting my tunes to my car speakers.  This is the best design and works the best of the three.  I like that it can charge my iPod and that the transmitter itself is inline.  The signal seems to be decent enough, though of course it crackles sometimes or you hear a bit of static.  This gets more pronounced the louder you make it.\\n\\nI think this is the safest for car use.  The iTrip is a nightmare because you have to change the station through the iPod.  So if you're taking a car trip (I live in NY but went to college in MI -- that's a 12 hour drive) and signals are coming in and out and you need to adjust, you really can't do it safely with the iTrip.  The Tunecast is a bit better, but that runs on batteries (the optional charger/power supply that I got for it didn't work).  Also, you can tune into any FM station with the up/down buttons, which is good, but you really only need the lower stations.  The iCarPlay has 8 frequencies it can transmit over and only 1 button.  Though I feel limited by the 8, I don't think going higher would help because there's more congestion.  I like the single button because there's no confusion whether you're going up or down and you can press the button, then easily tune the radio up a notch.  The other limitation I see is its iPod specific (uses dock connector) whereas the Tunecast just hooks into the headphone jack and it only works in cigarette lighters so you can't use it without a car (or something else with that power source).  But considering I bought it to use in my car, it does what it should and does a decent job of it\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nLet me just preface this review by mentioning that I read many customer reviews(here and elsewhere) on this product before purchasing it. I focused on the negative reviews as to develop a good idea of any potential design flaws. After using this keyboard for almost 6 months I believe that Saitek delivers an attractive design with solid quality. \\n\\nCommand Pad: Many reviews bash this feature. It is quite a basic pad as compared to some, but it gets the job done. My only main gripe with the pad was how it failed to deliver some windows macros such as ctrl-alt-delete. During games such as WoW and CoD2 I had no problems whatsoever. The rumor about the horrible software and it being buggy was nonexistent for me. The customers who claimed it to be \"impossible\" and \"buggy\" seem to be computer illiterate at best, and judging from the frequency of grammatical errors in their reviews, possible English illiterate as well. If you are familiar with computer hardware then you will be fine with this software and pad.\\n\\nKeyboard: The quietness, response, and overall feel of the keys rival any Logitech design. I am a huge fan/customer of Logitech equipment, and thus can confidently state that this board is of equal material quality. Saitek took a more simple route with this design(no LCD screen etc...) and the price shows it.\\n\\n*I almost laughed out loud after recently reading some of the passionate and disgruntled reviews concerning the lack of key-symbol illumination. It is obvious that these reviewers did not know much about the product they purchased. Unfortunately failing to be informed about a product one buys totally demerits any kind of negative opinion resulting from that lack of knowledge. I would guess that 90% of the negative reviews about this board capitalize on this point resulting in a much lower overall rating than deserved. \\n\\nLast and probably least comes the aesthetics, of course the most subjective part of any review. I found this setup to be very sharp looking. In the dark, the vivid key definition from the backlights allows any experienced typist to quickly find whatever he/she is looking for. This eliminates the need for symbol illumination. Although symbol illumination might be a nice touch, especially for the keyboard deficient, I feel that Saitek sacrificed this option to provide very durable lettering. I have lost some lettering on Logitech keyboards sooner than the 6 months I've been using this one(Although frequency of gaming has fluctuated). Saitek Engineers probably figured that most gamers would know the keyboard well enough to not need both key definition and symbol illumination, apparently an oversight on their part. \\n\\nI will recap this lengthy review by recommending this keyboard to any capable computer enthusiast who desires a good value.  \\n</review_text>,\n",

I have owned several Sony TVs and really thought hard about this purchase because of firmware issues that I have had with a 27\" Sony. Mainly compared this model with the corresponding Panasonic Tau, absolutely hated the Tau remote and am very familiar with the Sony. Note that the remote was not the deciding criteria, but it was a consideration. I have no real complaints about this TV, the menu system is nice and the picture very good. I do not normally use the built-in speakers so really can't comment about their sound. This TV has a 16:9 enhanced mode that must be selected from the menus, I tried it once using a DVD as source input and liked the widescreen format that the DVD player provides better than the 16:9 mode. The 27\" Sony that I have has an auto-volume feature, this 36\" does not and I do miss it. I would purchase this unit again. Note that there is a very similar Sony model that has upgraded sound, but not consider it because the added width would not fit in the armoire\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI agree with most of the reviews here.  The PC155 is a great headset overall.  The sound quality is great.  Volume is more than adequate and fidelity is excellent.  I've listened to a great deal of MP3 music through these babies and I am very impressed.  Spacial/stereo imaging is great and I've actually heard things in the songs that I have never heard before!  It actually shows the imperfections of my MP3 and makes me realize that I probably need to turn up the bit rate when ripping my CDs.  The controls are also simple to use, both on the cord and on the PC.\\n\\nAudio recording quality is great as well.  I have tried it with Dragon and recognition works great with it.  Playback of recorded sound shows that the sound is a little on the dark side, however.  Ps and Bs are a little too hot even though I have tried different mike positions and used the included wind sock.\\n\\nMy biggest problem with the set is in the comfort department.  I first feel obligated to tell you that I do not normally wear full coverage headphones.  Usually, I wear high-quality buds.  So, perhaps I just have to get used to it.  However, I feel as though my ears are being squeezed too much with these headphones.  Instead of feeling like they are comfortably secure, they feel as though they are too tight and they make my ears hot... even after only 15 minutes.\\n\\nSo, despite my positive review of the sound quality, I am going to send these back and try the PC165.  They supposedly have bigger ear cups, which will hopefully translate to more comfort?  Other people here have not had problems with the comfort of the 155s so it is probably just me.\\n\\nUPDATE: I received the PC165 set and there is a big difference.  The sound is fuller and bigger (not louder) on the 165s.  Also, the comfort is much better.  They don't pinch my ears like the 155s.  The cord going to the headset is also thicker, which means fewer tangles and less chance of damage.  If you're thinking of the 155s, I would get the 165s instead\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI purchased this headset for use with my Mac dG5 and Skype internet telephone.  The combination is killer.  I cannot compare to other similar equipment as this is my first and only, but for me, the quality is far better than what I have with my phone, and it was really as easy as plug and play.  I wish that the headset had thicker and stronger wires; I wish that the headset was more sold.  On the otherhand, I have not had any problems with the equipment up to now.  And the sound quality during telephone conversations is steller, which is important to me, especially as my hearing starts to deminish.  I saw some comments about the headset as an audiophile listening headphone.  IMO, this is too complementary.  For its price and features, a good buy and good sound quality, but IMO, this is not an audiophile headphone. \\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nAll 3 kids have a Tunebase.  It works great, easy to use.  It also charges the iPod while we travel\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI've gone through a ton of headphones in recent years. They've included Koss \"The Plug,\" Sennheiser PX100, Koss UR29, Koss SportaPro and a few others. All had their strong and weak points. So far, this has been the closest I've had to a good balance.\\n\\nFor my tastes (not necessarily anybody else's), strong bass is one of the most important things. The PX100 felt very weak in this area, despite what everybody else seemed to say -- weaker than my old Sony MDR-NC20 (which are still going strong after 6 years and remain my backup headphone of choice thanks to their decent sound and folding ability). I had problems keeping \"The Plug\" sealed in my ears, despite the \"hold the outer ear while the Plug seats\" advice. They're also a very a bad choice for iPods because their very low impedance overdrives the amplifier circuit. The SportaPros had great bass, but leaked way too much sound. The UR29 had good bass and very good isolation, but were a little uncomfortable, warm, heavy and too bulky to use on the go. Going back a few years, I had a pair of AKG K240s that had disappointing bass. Ditto for a pair of Sennheiser HD-420s.\\n\\nThe K26P seems to combine the better aspects of all these phones. The bass is among the strongest. When I listen to the 1812 Overture, the \"cannon blasts\" come through loud and clear, even at moderately low volumes, with no distortion at all. Isolation isn't as good as the UR29, but not too bad. Certainly a lot more portable, easy to stow in my bag at all times. The PX100s fold smaller, but they're a pain in the neck to stow in their hard case. The higher efficiency of the K26P means I can set my iPod at a lower volume. Instead of 55-60% of max volume with the UR29 or the stock earbuds, I now run at 35-40% comfortably. In terms of comfort, they're comfortable enough for hours of wearing, after a couple of slight modifications. If they press too hard on your hears, first extend the headband all the way, then GENTLY straighten each half a little bit by gripping a couple of inches of steel band at a time and unbending it. After a few tries, it should be perfectly fitted to your head. Don't bend too hard or grip the plastic parts or you can break the phones. Be patient. So it takes a couple of days of trial and error, but in the end, you get good-sounding phones that are wonderfully comfortable. You'd be surprised how little pressure is needed to produce a good seal. You'll know if you've unbent too far because either the phones will slide down or you lose bass. Here's an easy test: with a finger on each side, press the earcups harder onto your ears. If the bass doesn't get stronger as you press (the way it does with all open-air headphones), that's as good a seal as you need. I hated the little, square foam pads on the plastic sliders and quickly peeled them off. All they seem to do is create two pressure points on top of the head. Other phones with similar headbands (like the Koss SportaPro/PortaPro) don't use these pads, so I don't think they're really necessary. Better to let the headband rest directly on the scalp and distribute the pressure over the entire headband, and so far my suspicions seem to have been correct. It has been far more comfortable for me without the pads, especially after more than half an hour. In fact, without the pads, I barely feel the headband at all.\\n\\nOverall, I'm satisified, especially at its low price point. I hope to use these for many years to come until either they break or something better comes along. By the way, don't be put off by comments about the warranty being invalid in the US and Canada. Read the whole warranty sheet! A separate section on the sheet covers a limited warranty for these countries, so yes, it is covered\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the Sony SRF-M37V because of its five one-button pre-sets which make it a no-brainer to use while exercising.  However, the SRF-59, perhaps because of its analog tuning, suffers less from co-channel and adjacent channel interference on FM.  It's audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin.  With this in mind, I purchased another SRF-59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it.  I literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed I was having so much fun scanning the FM dial.  There was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bass-heavy 12\" remixes of eighties new wave hits with, blessfully, very limited commercial interruption.  Over the course of a three hour listening session, I gradually cranked up the volume.  As I was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds, it became apparent that with bass-heavy audio at very loud volumes the SRF-59's tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock Walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality (I understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output, therefore there will be no audio clipping).  Nevertheless, the sound quality from this bargain-priced Walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding.  The party is literally in your head, and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear, which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses.  I also made one pass through the AM band and there the SRF-59 was no slouch either.  I hauled in 1200 WOAI San Antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me.  Though no true DX machine, after all how could it be, it is at the least a competent performer on the AM band as well (I suspect early in the evening AM DXing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time).

The mic output is extremely crisp. While talking with clients they said that it sounds like I'm talking on the telephone with them or better. They are very comfortable and rest on the top of your head unlike many headsets like my prior pair which have a support on the back of the neck which does nothing. All in all a good headset.\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nThere are lots of reviews here and most appear to be on-target relative to my experience with these headphones.  But here are my 2 cents:\\nI got these to replace some aging Sony MDR-V2's that I purchased maybe 10 years ago.  The ear cushions of the MDR-V2's had begun to deteriorate, and I figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years.  I just compared them to the older V2s and I can say that the V6 is definitely better.  They fully surround the ears (V2s just sat on your ear, pressing on them).  The V6s also seem to offer more detailed sound.  I concur that they sound a little bright, but I can take care of this on my iPod by setting the EQ to ReduceTreble (but I like the brightness, so sometimes I don't do that).  I do NOT concur with other review comments about weak bass.  They appear to have the right amount.  (IMHO - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade, at the expense of flatness and non-coloring of sound).  I also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good (plenty loud for me with the iPod - and I listen at good levels - albeit not ear damaging ones).\\nAs a last comment, I notice Amazon has these for about $65.  I paid $99 at a local store.  Buy from Amazon !  (no - I don't work for or invest in them ;-\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI bought these after reading over a hundred reviews for them, and I agree with the consensus that they deliver a flat, uncolored sound with tight, but not boomy, or overpowering bass. By the way, I've owned the Sony MDR-V600's for a couple of years now thinking they had replaced these, but they are actually more of a consumer model that seem to be comparable in terms of price and specifications, but are actually quite inferior to these in my opinion. These have been used by Musicians, studio engineers, and on air talent for 20 years now\\n</review_text>,\n",

When they are wound up in their little yellow case, the headphones' wires are well protected from stress unlike other models that don't offer such security.\\n\\nCompared to other headphones I have used, especially noise cancelling of both active and passive varieties, these phones have superior bass response, and all levels of sound seem reasonably clear.\\n\\nI have used these earphones with many different devices over five years: CD players, MP3 players (including iPods), Pocket PCs, desktops, and notebooks.

The iTrip is a good choice over competitors' products and offers a good value for the money.  Radio reception is good; I especially like the changing channels feature.  The fact that it charges the iPod while in use even makes it better.  The only negative thing that I've discovered is that sometimes it disconnects from the iPod slot and I have to push it back.

I can always go into the web-interface to view or clear it with no problem.  Another thing to note regarding the log is that VPN (not pass-thru) has its own separate log area, which does not get emailed out.\\n\\nAs expected, Netgear support is mediocre.  Level 1 support can only handle very simple issues and Level 2 support is VERY slow.  I recommend you use the incident-submission area of the \"My Netgear\" website, so you can more easily track/respond to support incidents.\\n\\nFor those of you using the FR114p model, this is basically the same thing with 8-connection VPN service minus the printer port.\\n\\nI figure, after a few more firmware revisions, this will be a really good unit\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI have had and used two pairs of these headphones over the last year. I have been very happy with them, and even bought the second pair to keep as a backup. \\n\\nThe Good: They are not only noise-cancelling, but they also are rubber earbuds which fit snugly and comfortably in the ear, blocking more noise. If you put them on without any audio source, in only dulls background noise, but I think that's the best you can expect from any pair. While listening to audio, nearly everything is blocked out unless you really listen for it. There is a neck strap with the noise-cancelling component in the middle and the two earbuds hanging from each side. You put it around your neck like a necklace, put the buds in your ears, and use the power and volume controls on the noise-cancelling piece.\\n\\nThe Bad: Nothing is actually \"bad\" about them, but they're not quite perfect. The earbuds will easily slip out if you're sweating, or if they get at all greasy from your skin or earwax. However, they pop right off and you can wash them with a little soap and water in about 10 seconds. I do this daily when I use them. However, that doesn't make them the best solution for walking or jogging. Once one starts slipping, it generally won't stay in well until it (and your ears) have been cleaned, which detracts from the noise-cancelling effect. \\n\\nOther Thoughts: The cord is plenty long enough to reach an iPod or whatever at about belt level. However, if the player is in a pants pocket, it could be a little close. Also, I often wear it when I'm not using it, because you can forget it's there, and also it beats putting it into a pocket to get tangled. I had an issue once because I was sitting at a desk, and it dangled to the floor. When I stood up, I stood on the end and the force of my neck going up while my foot held it down damaged the wiring -- I began to get a slight buzz in one ear. However, I blame myself for that -- it was a mighty tug.\\n\\nI bought mine at Target, where they were labelled $24.99, on \"clearance\" from $49.99. A couple of months later they were back to $49.99. Once they dropped again to $34.99 (another \"clearance\" price), I bought a second pair as a backup. I'm glad I did -- I'm still using the second pair. Battery life is great. I don't know how many hours I get, but I can go at least a couple of weeks using my iPod for at least a couple of hours per day, listening to podcasts and audiobooks\\n</review_text>,\n",

Anything from Ambient, to Rock and Jazz. They produce sounds nicely, nice tight crisp. If these came with a woofer unit these would be ideal speakers, as the 2-pieces alone do not produce any significant bass at all. Just the \"hints\" of bass in the music but no thud, if that's what you are hoping for. I did turn these up loud to listen to their full sound and they do sound good.  These are perfect for offices and just daily music, sound is superb. Not for audiophiles or for people who are expecting to shake everything on their desks. \\n\\nBuild quality is \"ok\". I got the white speakers and they are the nice \"Mac\" white plastic. The JBL logo on the speaker itself is awfully big. And the silver volume knob is made of that cheap silver flake paint over plastic which is abit tacky. One of the soft rubber pads on the bottom of these (meant to not scratch your desk) did fall off during opening but they are glued on so no big deal in placing it back on.  \\n\\nThe design is very modern and cool tho. They look nice on my desk.\\n\\nYou will need to keep these on for abit to let the speakers fully... break in.

It simply plugs into any standard electrical socket and works off the base unit with one of the models mentioned above.\\n\\nThis phone was also very easy to register. (It had to be charged for about 2 hours before it could be registered...) I simply had to press the \"MUTE\" button on my base unit and then press the \"PLAY\" button on the phone (the registration directions were even displayed on the LCD display on the phone!) Please know that I did find the Panasonic instaltion manual/registration directions to be a little confusing.\\n\\nSome features that are NOT mentioned in this description which ARE included are: finger grips/ergonomic sizing on the sides of the phone, the opportunity to play your answering machine messages off this phone (the base unit to the KX-TG2730 has a digital answering machine, and I suspect the other Panasonic models do as well) ---- THIS WAS THE MAIN REASON WHY I PURCHASED THIS PHONE, YES THE KX-TGA271V WILL PLAY YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGES OFF THIS PHONE THROUGH THE SPEAKER ON THE BACK OF IT!!!, a separate \"call waiting\" dedicated button is also included.\\n\\nAlso, this phone will use any standard headset, it does NOT need a Panasonic branded headset. This was very important for me because I ofen use a headset and I do not want to purchase another one. I have since learned that ALL cordless phone headsets can be used on ANY type of cordless phone! \\n\\nPlease know that the batteries on this phone are not interchangeable with the KX-TG2730 system (that is the model that I have.) Also, the KX-TG2730 phone can't be charged in this charger, and vice versa. That is (likely) because the KX-TGA271V phone is slightly smaller and weighs less. \\n\\nThe face of the phone is white with a purple trim. The back of the phone is also purple on the bottom and white on the top half. The \"white\" in the phone is sort of a shiny metalic white, and the \"purple\" is not shiny at all. Some of the buttons are also slightly smaller than the buttons on the KX-TG2730 model. And the LCD screen is not flat, it is indented slightly, and bordered in silver. \\n\\nI purchased this phone from an Amazon.com merchant and am very pleased with it. I noticed that another Amazon.com merchant is selling the same phone that I purchased for less ($30.), however that merchant has HORRIFIC feedback and I was only too glad to pay a little extra for the confidence of knowing that I would receive a phone in a timely manner that would work! \\n\\nPanasonic makes very good phones. The only (big) problem is the battery life. The batteries often die after less than 90 minutes. I have solved this problem by purchasing a second set of batteries. However, this is still not a perfect solution. So, I had to purchase another set of cordless phones (Uniden.) I now keep two phones in each of the rooms that I had each of the Panasonic phones, and so far have not run in to any problems. I hope Panasonic will offer batteries with longer lives soon.\\n\\nAll in all this is an excellent phone. I hope the extra details that I provided will help a prospective buyer make the right decision. Amazon.com rarely provides specific details to these types of questions (does Amazon.com only employ braindead dimwits?) and the Panasonic Website does not offer this info\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI recently bought an HP 17\" widescreen laptop and needed to find a case for traveling. This case is all that and more...on one side is a detachable cell phone case...the other side a HIDDEN drink holder. It has a pocket that it slides into if not needed- that came in handy in the airport.\\n\\nThis case looks extremely sturdy (well built!)and dirt just seems to wipe right off of it. It holds my 17\" laptop, PDA, Cell phone, computer mouse, one-time-use cameras, Ipod, and all the wires and chargers for those electronics. I even fit two books, keys, a folder filled with directions and plane tickets, a notebook, and two dvd's in here. (all of that at the same time) Granted, all that stuff makes it pretty heavy to lug around the airport, so if you are doing that routinely you are going to want something with wheels or backpack form. The strap on this bag is extremely sturdy and cushiony. The strap was long enough for me to wear it diagonally accross my chest if I wanted, but it is not detachable (which means it isn't likely to fall off easily).\\n\\nThis bag is extremely well-designed. There is a strap for attaching it to wheeled luggage...it even fits under the window seat of the airplane and those areas for storage are much smaller than the aisle seats. Very well padded..I knocked my brand new computer around a bit during the travels and kept opening the case to make sure it was okay! Of course it was fine because there are 3 heavy duty layers of padding.\\n\\nBecause this bag does all that and more, it is large. It becomes larger the more you stuff it (obviously). However, I am 5'1\" and I carried it fine from North Carolina to New York. It looks great, if I needed to go to a meeting with my laptop I would gladly take it in this case. It looks professional enough.\\n\\nhappy buying!\\nps. let me add that finding a decently priced case for a 17\" laptop that has all the features this one does is nearly impossible. Also, in the stores I checked this was sold for about 30 dollars more than here on amazon!! If you have a smaller laptop, this case will work just fine too! It has an adjustable divider. You will just gain more room for other stuff. I look foward to long usage of this case.\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI've read the other reviews of this product and feel a need to defend this gadget. I've owned mine for about three years and I love it. I use it nightly. The application I find this perfect for is Audio Books stored on MP3. This of one of the only small, portable MP3 players that has it's own speakers. I go to bed listening to audio books and I don't want to wear a pair of earphones or lug a set of extra powered speakers around. However just slightly larger than a CD Walkman when folded closed it is small enough to work great on an airline trip, where headphones are preferable to the endless roar of the planes engines.\\n\\nThe big gripes I've seen repeated in the other reviews are:\\n 1) Poor radio reception.\\n 2) No Bass from the mini speakers.\\n 3) Short Battery life.\\n\\n1) I never use this to listen to the radio, so I won't comment on it good or bad. But there are thousands of good and cheep radio's on the market so if you need a radio, go buy a radio.\\n\\n2) I'll agree with the poor bass reproduction in the speakers. Small cone's yield small bass. It's a physics thing. However when I travel and use this to play music in a hotel room, it's been good enough to satisfy the want of a little background music.\\n\\n3) Battery Life. I'm surprised by the times listed by other reviewers. I get about 30-35 hours of use when I'm on the road using the AA's. When at home or in a hotel, the AC adapter removes the concern about battery life completely. \\n\\nPerhaps this is because I primarily play MP3 disks which it spins up to read into it's buffer then spins down until it needs more data. \\n\\nAnyway I wanted to toss in my two cents, as this is a great gadget for audio book listeners, and I would hate to see someone miss out on it because some reviewers expected the performance of a boom box or home stereo out of a Walkman sized device.. It's my hope that we'll see more devices like this on the market and the price point to come down a bit. But bottom line, I've got my monies worth, and if anyone doesn't want theirs, I'd be glad to take it off their hands.\\n</review_text>,\n",

Otherwise, as usual with Macs, very easy to use, even for low-tech people like myself, beautiful design, small and light, not too fragile, just great on the go\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI researched cases upon receipt of my 20 GB iPod and deemed this the best.  This case consists of a thin plastic sleeve inside a separate clear, hard shell.  The hard case protects the iPod from scratches and minor falls while still allowing easy access to the controls and inputs.  It also does not obscure the screen.  An enclosed plastic belt clip attaches to the back of the unit.  \\nThis case is not compatible with a Bose Sounddock as the user must remove the iPod from the case.  Also, Contour Design only enclosed one of the thin plastic sleeves.  I spent $5 at their website for 5 more sleeves and gave some to friends with the same case.  \\nThe price seems high for a couple pieces of plastic but a case is essential and this is the best one for the 20 GB iPod. \\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI've had this controller for over a year now, and it still works great and reliably as ever.  After many months, the analog sticks occasionally drifted a little, but a quick jiggle and they'd be back to center.  \\n\\nThe profiler software is excellent, allowing you to fully map the controller to your keyboard and even mouse.  This allows you to play any game with the controller, even ones which don't naturally support gamepads like Splinter Cell.  With the \"shift\" profile function, you can effectively double the number of buttons which I found great for playing a complicated flight sim like X-Wing Alliance, completely keyboard free, using only the gamepad.\\n\\nOnly downside: The D-pad is hard to control precisely.  It's difficult to press only Up, Down, Left or Right.  You almost always end up pressing a diagonal direction instead.  This made the D-pad more or less unusable for games like Street Fighter, but then the analog stick was a perfect alternative anyway\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nFirst, I should say that I'm surprised at how sharp and clear the image is.  The display card at CompUSA said this monitor has a 1000:1 contrast ratio, and I'm not sure what that means, but it definately seems to translate to a crystal clear picture.  The contrast ratio is higher than most other flat-panels I looked at, which have a contrast ratio of around 500:1 to 700:1 (including Samsung's own 20.1\" non-widescreen model).  Everything is crystal-clear, which makes it easy on the eyes and good for watching movies.  It is also good for gaming - Half-life 2 and Unreal Tournament 2004, for example, both look great.\\n\\nIts wide-screen resolution of 1680x1050 is more than decent for most tasks.  It also has a feature that lets you change the aspect ratio to 4:3 (which makes a square picture centered on the screen), so if you have any games or other applications that don't support widescreen modes, you can use 4:3 mode so that the picture doesn't look stretched and distorted.  Plus, the monitor has DVI, analog VGA, S-Video, and RCA inputs (which would allow you to plug in a DVD player if you want).  The monitor can also rotate 90 degrees, and it has built-in speakers and a headphone jack.\\n\\nBeing a flat-panel display, it is also lightweight and compact, which is ideal for areas where space is limited.  This is my first flat-panel display, and I was surprised at how lightweight it really is.\\n\\nAll of these features, especially the sharp image, make this a great monitor, and it is worth the money\\n</review_text>,\n",

A nice improvement would be a retractable cord facility so that you don't have excess cordage lying around your dashboard. Right now I loop the excess around the steering wheel but then again I never change the adjustment on the steering wheel so no problem with the wire getting caught up in the adjusting mechanism. Others may run into this problem. The alternative is a shorter wire but then it would make the power unit useless for some vehicles. A minor hitch but not earthshaking.\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nThis case is a veritable dirt magnet.  It attracts more lint than I ever knew existed on my desk.  However, it protects very well.  One thing I was worried about was the possibility of the hard plastic front of the case scratching my screen.  However, it doesn't even touch the ipod.  Also I worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel.  While it isn't quite as sensitive, it makes it more precise in my opinion, seeing as how I all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when I wanted in the S range without the case on.  This blue case even looks good on my black ipod, even though I was worried the color would appear muted.  It's still vibrant.  \\n\\nOne complaint that some have already brought up is the covered hold button.  Truthfully this doesn't bother me, because I have long enough fingernails to dig in and push the button.  But those without could have a great deal of difficulty.  Also, the hole for the headset isn't quite large enough, and sometimes my headphones will pop out (I'm not using the earbuds that came with the ipod, so I do not know how those would fare).  \\n\\nOverall, it's a great case that you won't lose your grip on.  It protects well, and you never have to take it off, even to plug it in.  I would recommend it, though it is a bit pricy.    \\n\\nIn a bit of an update, with this case on, my iPod survived a ferret attack, with only one little tiny puncture mark on the outside of the case.  I think this case is well worth the money.  My iPod could have been destroyed, but it's perfect\\n</review_text>,\n",

The system works fine in our 2-story, 2,300 sq. ft. home.  I did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house.  As a test I took the handset down the street about 100 yards away - it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street.

Midrange is balanced so well that you'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist, and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes. The folding feature is handy.\\n\\nThe only things to be aware of are the following:  First, you have to break them in.  They start sounding better after a few hours of use.

       " <review_text>\\nThe KOSS Pro-4AA's were not made for iPod/MP3 headphone users.  TO begin with, they reveal the low fidelity of MP3 files (compared with LP's or CD's).  Also, they require a 1/4\"-to-3.5mm (or other) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment.\\n\\nThese Headphones have been around a long time. Check out the old photos of the \"Watergate\" hearings from 1973/1974, and notice that the Senators &amp; attorneys were all listening through KOSS Pro 4AA headphones.  Their longevity is mainly due to their extermely high fidelity audio reproduction. Unfortunately, their age has made them somewhat inconvenient for most listeners, since they are very heavy and a bit cumbersome.\\n\\nNEGATIVES:\\n1) Weight (about 3 or 4 times as heavy as most contemporary studio-reference headphones)\\n2) Tight headband - as noted, the fit is fatiguing if your 'hat size' is greater than 7 1/2.\\n3) The coiled cord is extremely difficult to replace (it's actually less expensive to replace the entire set of headphones of you can get a good discount).\\n\\nPOSITIVES:\\n1) AUDIO FIDELITY. Unless you want to spend at least $300 for a set of headphones, the sound quality and fidelity of the Pro-4AA's is almost impossible to beat.\\n2) VALUE. As noted above, for the price you pay, these are vastly superior to any other headphones that are comparably priced.\\n3) DURABLE. My first pair lasted 30 years.  They were dropped and knocked around, and finally gave out when (It think) a voltage spike surged in the left earphone, fusing a coil.\\n4) ISOLATION. THe paddded earphones block out external sound very well.\\n\\nThe sound fidelity is preserved over a wide volume range. These sound great at low and high volumes.\\n\\nThe biggest Positive (and the reason why I prefer to use Pro-4AA's for audio mixing, other studio applications, and serious listeining) is that they are extremely unlikely to be stolen.  Size matters: they are heavy, and bulky so they're not easily concealed; and since iPOD or MP3 players use the mini plugs, these require additional hardware.  If you just want 'jogging/exercise music', then these will not work well. If you want hi-fidelity at a bargain price, the Pro-4AA's are still the best choice around.\\n\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nMy first purchase of the Q9b resulted in a return as the display wasn't mounted properly within the plastic housing. This resulted in the screen being tilted downwards about 1/4\" and made the viewing unpleasant. The screen also wasn't very bright even with the brightness controlled up at 100%. Having to disassemble the unit to place it back in the box required the base stand to be taken apart but that was next to impossible without breaking it. Suffice to say, quality control missed this one.\\n\\nAfter getting a new Q9b replacement, I unfortunately had a bad pixel. After using the Q9b for a week now, I noticed some red aliasing between characters. The crispness of the display is fine but I changed display fonts to 120dpi to make it look better. The control buttons on the monitor are too small. The built-in speakers leave less than desired and useless. \\nThe Q9b does not have DVI ports. At 1280x1024 mode its fine for doing basic computing like web surfing and office applications. Viewing DVD movies at full 1280x1024 mode was difficult to watch.  At smaller sizes (400x300) was fine.\\n\\nAll in all, the Q9b is not a bad monitor for the price for general computing work\\n</review_text>,\n",

Then I bought the Lowrance but it was too heavy and the mount was a sgood as the Cobra. I returned the Lowrance and bought the Garmin 340.\\n\\nAdvantages of the Cobra is that it has a large screen and a solid mount (despite its size).  The interface isn't quite as intuitive as Garmin but once you learn it it is actually better.  The traffic service is also nice (costs more with the Garmin).  The Cobra is the most capable of the GPS units I mentioned but overall I am happier with the Garmin because of it's smaller size and lower price\\n</review_text>,\n",

I am very impressed with the GPS, but the mount used to attach the unit to the window or dash is very poorly designed.  The unit falls off the window and from the dash, plus the power cord comes out too easily.  The unit deserves a five star rating, but because of the mounting system and power cord coming out too easily a four star rating was provided.\\n</review_text>,\n",

BusinessWeek as reviewed all the major GPS navigation options on the market and ranks the Cobra NAV ONE 4500 as number one.  Here is an excerpt from the BusinessWeek article:\\n\\n\"Cobra's NAV ONE 4500 and Garmin's StreetPilot 2720, which each sell for $800 to $1,000, use a more straightforward approach. The traffic info travels along with FM radio broadcasts from Clear Channel stations in 48 of the top 50 markets. An FM antenna and receiver pick it off the air and feed it to the navigation system.\"\\n\\n\"I preferred the Cobra, mostly for its big, bright 5-inch screen and its built-in radio receiver. (The Garmin receiver is $200 extra and needs to be installed between your car antenna and radio.) When you encounter traffic, a pop-up on the screen and a voice give you three options: Keep driving, reroute me, or give me a couple of new routes and let me pick one.\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI've owned this headphone for about a year now, and I've got to say, after going through multiple headphones, this beats all others I've tried. If this one ever broke (I doubt that'll happen anytime soon), I'll surely buy another one again!\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- Comfortable to wear. The ear cushions are indeed comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Even if you wear glasses, you won't feel uncomfortable.\\n\\n- Clear treble, middle, and bass. You can hear all the subtle sounds in your song clearly. Even with completely flat EQ setting, the headset does very good job with sound (provided you increase the volume up a bit more). As with any headphones, take time to 'break it in' to have it function the best it can (it means, to leave music playing on the headphone for very extended period of time non-stop, about 24 or 32 hours).\\n\\n- Sturdy wires. This headphone seems to have been designed based on recording studio-level headphones in this regard. The wire is very thick and long. Also, it's single wire format.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Ear padding is perhaps, too soft. This means it won't fully cover your ear area, and some of sound may leak out. So note that when you listen to your music loud in public places. Although, at first few weeks, the ear padding is relatively hard. If you are looking for a headphone that will ensure your music will never leak out, look into getting in-ear canal type headphones instead.\\n\\n- As some others have pointed out, tilting your head too forward or backward will make your headphone just drop from where it is at. So be cautious of your movements.\\n\\n- You might not want to wear this kind of headphone during summer due to poor ventilation. But this affects all closed headphones, so it's not a huge negative point.\\n\\n- The headphone is quite big and on a small head, you may have a difficult time keeping it up on your head. The size of the headphone is designed for a fully grown average adult head.\\n\\nThat's all I've got to say, and overall, this headset is definitely worth your money\\n</review_text>,\n",

Of course, any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard/mouse setup, but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever I wish.\\n\\nThe only drawback, and it is minor, is getting used to the fact that there are no lights on the keyboard to indicate when CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK is on. I have to look over at the wireless receiver for this. Additionally, it would be nice if there was an option for the keyboard to be backlit.

It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\\n2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\\n3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\\n4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\\n5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\\n6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\\n\\nSo, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don't hold me liable since I don't have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.\\n\\nAssuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn't get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI was hesitant to get this, since other reviewers gave it poor ratings on reception.  Now that I bought it, I'm very glad I have it.  It does all the things you might want in a disaster, inluding a flashlight, red flashing light (especially if your car breaks down at night), a siren (if you're trapped in a building), AC, battery, and crank power, and multiple radio bands.  While some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations, in a disaster, you only need a few stations, as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news.  Between the AM, FM, TV, and NOAA bands, my radio will received a huge number of stations--many more than would ever be needed in a disaster.  (I didn't try the cellphone charging function.)  It comes in a carrying case.\\nOnly minor criticisms:  The case seems like an afterthought:  it doesn't hold the AC adapter; the knobs tend to turn the radio on when putting it in the case, and the knobs could get broken off if the case is hit (not that protective). However, it comes in a strong box which is perhaps better storage for everything.\\nOverall, this is all you should need for light, siren, and broadcast information from multiple power sources in a disaster\\n</review_text>,\n",

Once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable WEP and put in the key and passphrase, I had to turn WEP back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender.  Basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5, this is what worked for me at any rate.\\nI've had it for about 4 months now and it has worked as advertised.  I gave it 4 stars because set up was still kind of a pain.\\n\\nFrom S Huff: The tips that Anthony Taylor left helped me get it working... but I still had some issues. I've added onto his tips from his review below \\n\\n1-Disable WEP on your Router or AP \\n2-Hold the auto-configuration button for 30 seconds(if everything goes well both lights on the expander will turn blue) and unplug while still holding button. Plug back in after 10-15 secs. \\n3-open your Internet explorer browser and type 192.168.1.240 (default ip of expander), a window will pop up. leave the user name blank and put admin as a password (this is default password). \\n4-make sure that the default gateway and subnet mask settings are identical with your Router or AP,change password on the expander if desired &amp; save settings. (all settings should be correct due to auto configuration) \\n5-Enable WEP on the expander, once again remember use same settings that you will be putting in your router or AP in step 6 -- aka same passphrase), save settings again. \\n5.5 - As soon as you enable WEP on your expander - you will loose your connection to it as it's now setup for WEP and your router isn't - keep this in mind - drove me nuts. \\n6-Go to your Router or Ap settings and enable WEP. \\n7 - UNPLUG your expander for 10 to 15 seconds and plug it back in -- Bang you're DONE.

       " <review_text>\\nI have had this TV since Mid-March 2006. I absolutley love it!! I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect, especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing \"Bourne Supremecy\" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy.\\nAs far as where to buy it, I recommend Best Buy. I originally was going to buy from Amazon because when I first looked they were offering free shipping. When I decided to buy their was no longer free shipping, so off to Best Buy I went where they price matched me with amazon's price no questions asked. Best Buy offers an extended warranty for around $400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems. It will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it.

       " <review_text>\\nThere is a little story before this:\\n\\nI bought a pair of Sony MDR-XD100's (they are full cup headphones) because I lost the earbuds which came with my mp3 player (Sony HD5). I took them out of the package and found that, even at full volume on the player, it cannot drive the headphones sufficently. I went to a few electronics stores then found the KOSS EQ50.\\n\\nOn with the review:\\n\\nYes, there is a slight hiss, but I find it alright. The biggest gripe I have is that whenever someone within about 2-3 ft (IE, on a bus or subway) uses a cellphone, this devices picks it up. You can get the same effect by using a cellphone next to an unshielded pair or speakers. I do most of my listening at home so this won't bo too much of an issue.\\n\\nIt also does a great job of amplifying the signal, it works very well, I can now listen to my XD100's properly (and they are very good!). I haven't used the EQ much but what I can say is that it is very, very sensitive. Raising the bass slider a third above normal makes a massive difference. At a half, my headphones start to distort.\\n\\nIf your looking for a nice little EQ and/or preamp this is the product for you. It has its drawbacks though, mainly the problem with cellphone interference and of course, the hiss but it isn't too loud &amp; I can live with it.\\n\\nI reccomend this product if your looking for a budget portable equalizer or headphone amplifer\\n</review_text>,\n",

I tried four different cases, both hard plastic and silicone variants, and the iskin case comes the closest, protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use.\\n\\nThe case is basically a hybrid of hard plastic and soft silicone.  The ipod first slips into a silicone sleeve, which covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen.  In addition, there is a hard plastic plate that is then inserted into seems on the front of the silicone case, and this provides the screen protection.  Due to the double-seam in the silicone, the plastic plate never comes in contact with the ipod, so you don't have to worry about it scratching.\\n\\nThe case even has a flap that covers the dock connector, preventing dust from entering, yet you can still use the universal dock without removing the case.\\n\\nThe most unique part of this case is that it covers the clickwheel, but the silicone is so thin that it hardly impedes the scrolling.  Actually, I think it provides just enough resistance so that you will overshoot your target much less than with the bare clickwheel.\\n\\nThe only real downside I found with the iskin is the clip that comes with it--I would not trust it at all, so I took it off.  It would be nice to have a better clip that you can actually use, and it would be really great to have an armband available for it as well, but as I said above, I have yet to find a perfect ipod case.  Like most silicone cases, this one does also attract lint in your pockets, etc., but it is not as bad as other cases.\\n\\nUnfortunately, even though this is a great case, it is not readily available.

       " <review_text>\\nI tried both Microsoft's LifeCam VX-3000 and VX-6000. Had 'em both home and ran trials with my Intel Pentium D Dual Core 3.00GHz CPU with 2 gigs of ram and, with both of those, the video lagged the audio (distractingly so). Spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly Microsoft customer service rep one evening (got through on their toll free line)and he pointed me to new software for the VX-6000. Downloaded the 50 meg plus file, installed it, but the VX-6000 still produced out-of-sync video vs. audio when I created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on Media Player or editing in Windows Movie Maker. \\n\\nSo, I talked to some technicians at our company and then talked to the webcam guru at the local assembler that built my, I believe, excellent computer. All recommended Logitech when buying webcams. I then marched back to Best Buy and traded my $99 Microsoft VX-6000 for a Logitech Quickcam Orbit MP for BB's price of $139.95. You can find this Logitech unit cheaper all over the place, including, of course, here at Amazon. The package I bought included an inexpensive headset, which I haven't used so far.\\n\\nAlthough I haven't tried the Orbit in a video phone call yet, from the moment I turned it on I had that satisfing good feeling that I bought a winner. Installed fairly easily with a couple of bumps. Got a \"USB composite device has not passed Windows Logo testing\" screen a couple of times..BUT..I received the SAME screen on, get this, the Microsoft cams! I just continued installing and have not experienced system problems so far.\\n\\nThe audio sync with video in making a recording is right on (remember, that was primary reason for taking back the Microsoft cameras) AND the picture clarity on my LCD flat panel monitor at the 640 webcam capture setting produced a gorgeous picture. Excellent detail and smoothness of video. Besides the superior audio sync with video, the Orbit MP is remarkably better than the VX-6000 and way above the $49 Microsoft VX-3000 in all other criteria too, in my opinion after comparison testing.\\n\\nThe Orbit's special effects are interesting and fun. The pan, tilt, etc., excellent. The face tracking is vigorous and alive - fun to watch the little Orbit camera turn - but I haven't tested in actual live conferencing yet.\\n\\nAll in all - for webcams, I'm now saying what more experienced webcam users told me - head for Logitech. They've certianly hooked me with their apparent superior performance. The Orbit MP is a keeper! Not going to waste anymore time searching and testing. And, my advice to Microsoft, you'd better talk to the outfit that bought your name for those Lifecams. I've relied on the Microsoft name on peripherals, keyboards, etc., and I've generally been very satisfied. But, in webcams, with me, the Microsoft brand now takes a back seat to Logitech.\\n\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nGarmin iQue M5\\n\\nI'm very pleased with my little iQue M5 GPS/PDA.  While it's not perfect, it's pretty darn amazing. I had actually purchased a Lowrence iWay 350 GPS, but then my husband discovered the iQue on sale at Costco for about [...] more.  With the iQue offering so many more features, I returned the Lowrence and purchased the iQue.  With my husband and I both having the same machines, we can beam information to each other or send them over Bluetooth.\\n\\nIt has taken many hours of playing around with it to get to learn the device, as it isn't very intuitive and the manuals, especially for the PDA, are limited. My husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the GPS, and he's learning its idiosyncrasies as far as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas.  It's very sophisticated and the maps are great - better detail than the Lowrence.  We purchased a 2 Gig memory card and downloaded the entire map database onto it, and there were still 300 gigs to spare.  I had no trouble downloading the maps or the Active Sync software.  The basic GPS functions are easy to use once you get the hang of it, the voice directions are clear and concise, and it re-routes quickly if you go off course.  You can plan your route in advance without having the GPS activated.  This is a good idea, since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites, and you can be on your way if you've viewed your route before starting out.\\n\\nI used the GPS on a trip Stratford, Canada, and it was wonderful having the Canadian maps as well as the US maps available. I even used it handheld while walking to my bed-and-breakfast from the theater.  Every once in awhile there is a glitch (it said the theater was on the left, which would have taken me into the Avon River!), but it's generally right on target and I find most of the problems are operator error, such as turning too soon. The \"Route to Home\" feature is very convenient. Granted, the iQue doesn't always take you on the shortest route, but it will get you where you're going and if you're \"directionally challenged\" like I am, it becomes indispensible.\\n\\nThe car mounting bracket works fine.  It's popped off occasionally in hot weather, but generally stays put. The bracket would be easy to move to another vehicle.  The GPS would work in a cup-holder if you needed to use it in a rental car.\\n\\nI've spent more time learning the PDA portion, which uses Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition. The iQue uses Outlook as its interface, so you'll have to have it installed on your computer. Not having used Outlook before, I installed Outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting familiar with it, which was helpful.  \\n\\nThe PDA has so many functions that it's hard to even describe what this little machine can do.  It will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts, checks e-mail, accesses the Internet if you get a Wi-Fi card, recognizes handwriting, has a voice recorder, interfaces with other Bluetooth units, sends alarms, has Word and Excel, even has a couple of good games.  I got a separate SD card for music and downloaded a lot of songs, and the sound through headphones is quite acceptable (it has bass boost).  It uses Windows Media Player so you can organize all of your playlists.  You can download any programs that are available for Windows Mobile 2003, including TV shows and videos.  I never thought I'd find much use for a PDA but I'm using it every day.  No more little notes on scraps of paper or a separate pocket calendar, address book or even an IPod.  Everything is in one handy-dandy little machine. And even though it isn't that intuitive, once you've learned the basic conventions they translate to most of the programs.\\n\\nWe've called Garmin Tech Support a few times and, although they are only open during regular business hours, we found American staff who are very knowledgeable about the product.  Since a good GPS will run at least [...], this was a great bargain at around [...]  We've purchased screen protectors and are hoping it won't wear out too quickly, as I've heard Palm Pilots tend to do.  I'm really enjoying the iQue.\\n\\n\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nWe bought this about a month ago from Amazon.  The product itself seems fine - we used it on a vacation drive from NJ to Myrtle Beach and back.  At times, it was a help (like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in VA and we needed an alternate route).  However, you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it doesn't always recommend the best or shortest route.  Also, it was missing certain stores, restaurants, etc. that had been around for awhile.\\n\\nWe liked that it is a PDA though.  My husband drives limos so he wanted a mapping device for help but we hope to load some games into it.

I found this unit to be easy to use with a large display and convenient controls. Also the 2 times I called Garmin with questions I was able to talk to someone who is in the USA as opposed to a person in a foreign country which can be frustrating to some. On the down side to get the most out of this unit you still need to buy additional mapping software\\n</review_text>,\n",

We're planning a 2000 mile road trip from Utah up to the Oregon coast.  We needed something with expandable memory so we could upload more than one state map at a time.  My wife bought me the Magellan eXplorist 600 for Fathers Day.  I forced myself to use it for two days (and believe me, it was torture).  I could go on and on about why I sent it back.  \\nWhat I ordered as a replacement was the GPSMap 60Cx.  Now keep in mind that I felt like someone who had turned to the dark side.  \\nI couldn't be happier with my decision.  \\n\\nWhile I agree with most of the other reviews about the lack of base maps, and the expense of additional ones, this unit ROCKS!  It acquires satellites within seconds.  It has expandable memory.  It has a color screen.  It manages Geocaches.  It auto-routes.  It stores 1000 waypoints.  It has SiRF Technology.  It is a USB interface.  It has a belt clip.  It changes display contrast at night (automatically).  It slices...  It dices....\\nSuddenly the Dark Side isn't so dark!!\\n\\nThis is a great unit that I would recommend to anyone. \\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI had been talking about wanting an MP3 player, but I did NOT want an iPod, as I heard you cannot add files in Windows format and that's what all of my music is.  I received this e260 4 GB MP3 player for my birthday in June 2006, and this is the first MP3 player I have ever owned.  Although there are a few little quirks, overall I am not disappointed and would recommend this MP3 player.\\n\\nLike many rechargeable battery-powered items, it required a lengthy initial charge before first use.  After that, the future charges don't seem to take as long.  The MP3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge.  Although I've never run it completely down, I have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues.\\n\\nI installed the software on my computer, and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual.  I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual, and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it). \\n\\nIt came pre-loaded with 20 songs, only one of which I had ever heard of (and it was one of those no-name bands that played once on Saturday Night Live).  Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices, I decided to leave them on there until I need the space.  About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months.  I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more.\\n\\nAs far as performance goes, it performs pretty well.  The buttons are a little difficult to get used to, as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  Not too bad, but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there, you will be scrolling a lot.  \\n\\nI do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player.  It has music, fm radio, photo, voice, video and a settings option.  I have used the music function and the voice recorder option, both with good results.  The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer.  It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer.  As for syncing music files, I have not had any problems, although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded, but when you try to play it, it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list.  I don't know what caused this.  Also, you can only store a song as one genre, which is a little annoying.  Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player, you cannot change the genre.\\n\\nIt came with a headset, but I have never used it.  Instead I purchased some Panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it.  \\n\\nI do wish the MP3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer's USB drive to charge.  Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen.  I can't remember it being dropped or anything, so I don't know what caused this, but it's pretty noticeable.  It doesn't seem to affect the operation, just the aesthetics.\\n\\nOverall, the cons are little irritations to me and I would recommend this player to someone who doesn't want an iPod\\n</review_text>,\n",

When it's on, tunes that i had deleted will still appear on my play list. If I hit play on such song, the player just skips and plays the next song on the list. \\n\\nBut overall i'm happy with my MP3. I'd recommend it\\n</review_text>,\n",

This was confusing as I did have the correct cartridges in the printer. A \"replace cartridge\" message would have been less ambiguous.\\n\\n2) The printer has so far appeared \"dead\" once. When I went to turn it on, it would not do so. The solution is on HP's website - you must remove the rear door and do a hard reset. I did this and the printer worked fine again.\\n\\nThe printer does not come with a USB cable, but those can be easily bought for $14-20.\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI'm a skeptic. No, I mean I'm REALLY a skeptic... especially in today's marketplace (because nothing is built like it used to be). I don't buy anything without checking it out first, and even then, I expect that it's probably going to fail me when I do. Yeah, wonderful view there, huh?\\n\\nWell, needless to say, I was pleasantly (and quite happily) surprised when this device didn't fail me out of the box. I've been using my speedpad for almost a year now, and I have to say that it has been by far more solid, responsive and intuitive than I ever expected it to be. I will not play a PC game without it plugged in now, that's how well this gamepad has worked for me.\\n\\nHere are the ins and outs:\\n\\n1) Solid construction. As others have stated, this device feels very solid and is just generally \"sturdy as hell\". This, alone, surprised me. Not too many electronic devices are solidly made these days (not too many at all!)... so I'm glad to see that this one was. Belkin did an excellent job in this department.\\n\\n2) Software. Do yourself a favor, when you get this device home, don't bother putting in the CD that comes with it. Instead, go directly to Belkin's website first-thing, download the newer version of the software (which is near exactly the same as what's on the CD, but updated) and install that *before* plugging in your speedpad for the first time. Do that and you'll have everything updated immediately with little to no trouble at all.\\n\\nI've had no problems with the software for this hardware (and that's generally the part I have trouble with the most). The applications (profiler and button editor) function perfectly, and macros are a snap to program. Kudos to Belkin's programmers on writing the software suite for this, they did a good job.\\n\\n4) Sticky keys. Most people have experienced this.. myself included. Being possibly a byproduct of the solid construction of the product, basically, what happens is the keys stick just a little bit coming out of the box. Though just \"excercising\" the device (pressing the buttons down quickly and solidly over and over) for a few seconds after plugging it in each time I went to use it cleared up this issue within the first week of using the gamepad, and I've never had it happen since. \\n\\n5) Other buttons. \\n* The mouse scroll wheel can be an annoyance, and I don't use it much at all because it's hard to scroll up and down with it (Belkin may just have made that particular button a little *too* solid). \\n* The orange button above the d-pad also isn't that easy to press, though if you keep you pinky finger positioned on the side of the keypad for leverage, it's not impossible to press this button (in fact, I use it as my default \"map\" button in most of the games I play). It's perfect for those functions you use enough to need a button for but not enough to need an easy spam button.\\n* I haven't experienced any problems hitting the 'space' button below the d-pad that others have experienced. My thumb taps that button as easily as it taps the space bar on a standard keyboard. My only complaint with it is that I can't simply twist my thumb a bit to hit the key, I have to actually lift my thumb off the d-pad to do it - and that's not much of a complaint at all, really.\\n\\nThe d-pad itself is a godsend! I'm a true console gamer, having used nothing but d-pads for movement since all the time spent playing my old NES as a kid (and using a joystick before that with my even older Atari). D-pad is all I know, really. In fact, the one thing that's kept me away from PC gaming all these years is I've never, ever been able to accustom myself to using arrow keys or WASD for movement (and probably never will get accustomed to that either). For the longest time I was looking for a device that could allow me to keep the sensitivity of mouse aiming (to keep up with other PC players) while giving me an actual d-pad for movement... and that is EXACTLY what this gamepad did for me. \\n\\nAs I said at the top of this review, I will never play a PC game without my Nostromo speedpad plugged in. This gamepad has provided the one benefit that other pads haven't and that I really needed - a controller interface that's actually functional and intuitive enough to use that I forget I'm using it most of the time, allowing me to immerse myself completely in whatever game I'm playing... which is really the point of gaming in the first place, isn't it? \\n\\nThe Nostromo Speedpad gets 5 stars from me. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for the type of benefits I've listed. And, for that matter, I'm recommending it right now in fact...\\n</review_text>,\n",

The case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket, unlike so many other cases.  The obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface, this case won't provide much in a way of side protection (klutzes be warned).

The handsets are about 6 inches long not including the antenna part, 1 and 7/8 inches at the widest point by the display, and 1 and 1/8 inches thick at the thickest point.\\n\\nDoesn't interfere with my wireless internet or any of my other electronics.  I've used the phone while sitting next to my laptop, while both I and the chargers were next to TV and stereos, and with my cell phone going at the same time - no interference.\\n\\nThe speakerphone part isn't that great - the person on the other end can hear other sounds in the room, plus they say it sounds like I'm speaking from a great distance away.  But I've never had a phone with a good speakerphone, so wasn't expecting that to work anyway.\\n\\nWould have been great if they'd included a headset that goes with it since the handsets do have headset jacks.  I love the extra handsets that only need to be plugged into a power outlet - solved my lack of working jacks problem!!\\n\\nThe display lights up when it rings and when you press any of the keys.  The keys are not backlit.  The menus are fairly intuitive - if you've ever had a cell phone you can figure this out pretty easily.  It's very easy to send phone numbers that you've programmed into one handset to all the other handsets or only to a specific handset.\\n\\nWhen I first hooked everything up, the phones got no dial tone, but the problem was with the phone cord that plugs into the phone jack in the wall.  For some reason, the cord they provided didn't work, so when I swapped it out with the cord I had, all the phones worked fine.\\n\\nI'd buy these again and recommend to others to buy\\n</review_text>,\n",

The extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who don't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward, backward, and switch between programs. The button in the middle though (the one that lets you switch programs) is out of the way. It takes just a bit more effort to use, meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button. I actually hardly ever use that button. I can't live without the forward/backward buttons though. I find myself man-handling other mice thinking they too have those neat, little buttons. The mouse has a really good response to movement as well. I've used it for gaming as well, though I admit I'm not a hardcore gamer. I really recommend this mouse.

Hewlett-Packard printers tend to be the most friendly when it comes to buying refilled cartridges or refilling your own cartridges.\\n\\nIt prints fast, it prints well, and I enjoy the double-sided printing feature.  This printer has been consistently rated by users as being accurate in its color prints, although I've done little color printing myself.\\n\\nThe scans are not the greatest as they leave small artifacts at regular intervals when you zoom in in Photoshop.  The artifact is a vertical line which bisects the picture and offsets each side by a few pixels.  They're not really noticeable to the naked eye and you won't see them unless you're editing the picture and have blown it up considerably.  Still, it's probably not the best for archiving your photos.

I have both the Canon Photo Plus Glossy and the Photo Pro papers.

There may be a benifit to the \"Pro\" paper that cannot be seen (lasts longer?) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it - this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your Canon printer (I think they look better than the ones I get from the photo lab)\\n</review_text>,\n",

AFter about 30 seconds, it beeped, clicked, and temporarily DROPPED power to the computer while it was rebooting! So when it switches back from battery power it causes power to be interrupted.

       " <review_text>\\nHere is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17, 2006:\\n\\nWe bought this machine just over a year ago (a year and two weeks, to be specific).  We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder (DMR-E55) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVD-RAMs on both.  For a long time, the ES10S recorder worked fine.  Recently, though, it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down, and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks, ejecting them, and even playing them.  At first we thought this might be because we'd recorded over the DVD-RAMs so many times.  But today we tested one of them in the other machine, which has never made any similar noises, and the E55 had no problems with it.  Needless to say, we're not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying, especially since the 1-year warranty just ended.  If you buy or own this machine, follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you're within the warranty period, because the noises and problems just get worse.  Panasonic is usually a reliable brand, one we've used for many years, but this machine seems to be a lemon.  We're actually going to write to Panasonic about it--I'll try to post again with the results.\\n\\nHere is my update, which I wrote November 3:\\n\\nThis is a follow-up review to the one above, which I wrote on June 17. I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended. They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair, including labor, of the machine at one of three places they listed. The places were all within a half-hour drive of my home. After doing some research, I chose one and brought in the machine. They fixed it by replacing \"the entire internal mechanism\" (I don't know what that means). We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July; it's now the beginning of November. The fixed machine worked fine for a while, but in the past few weeks, we've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before. I'm going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund, because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it. It's still working, but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won't. Avoid this machine. Again, the previous Panasonic model (DMR-E55) we bought hasn't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great. We're still big Panasonic fans, but this particular model is a lemon.\\n\\n</review_text>,\n",

I would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts. This device has become nothing more than a nuisance that won't even pick up radio stations.

Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS\\n</review_text>,\n",

You can use a PDA stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip.  It's amazing.  But I wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it's internal maps and waypoints.  But I tried a local test first.  I used roads as waypoints, main roads.  This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes.  I did not like it's choices, since it is a dated map database.  I set up a local route, and started to follow it.  It took me to the first road/waypoint no problem.  But it would not go past the first waypoint.  I would go down the road (first waypoint) then it would tell me to take a u turn!.  I did.  Then it said take another u turn.  It had me going in circles.  Perhaps it's not made to use roads as waypoints, but all indications it gave were that it would.  The manual was no help.  Support was no help.  So it went back.  I have ordered a Garmin i2.

As for the short cord, I solved that issue by getting a USB extension cord at the same time. Besides solving the immediate problem, this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point, and using the extension cord for some other purpose.\\n\\nFor a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do. I attached an external hard drive through it. I used it for a compact flash card reader, and a digital camera. I connected an inkjet printer. Everything worked, once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly. (This was all with Windows 98 SE.)\\n\\nBut after a while, things started getting less reliable. The system would tell me that various \"drives\" (on the flash card reader, or the external hard drive) were not available. Or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software. And the printer even started disappearing.\\n\\nPlaying with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life, and eventually I deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose, or with wiring inside the device. Either way, it has finally become a big problem, and I am shopping for a replacement.\\n\\nMost of the devices I connected were self-powered, that is, they did not need to draw power from the hub or the PCI channel at all. The hard drive, camera, and printer were all powered by batteries or AC adapters of their own. And the flash card reader, which did draw power from the hub, used to work fine. It does not matter what combination of devices I try, sooner or later the connection goes bad.\\n\\nIt is of course possible that there's something wrong in the PC -- but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself. So I have to recommend against buying it. I suspect it is discontinued and that this advice won't be necessary for much longer, but I want to prevent somebody from the bother I've been through, just in case\\n</review_text>,\n",

The one I got came with a CD with the wrong drivers. With tech support, I finally found the 8 mb driver file I was supposed to download. However, they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver. The normal \"automatic\" approach did not work. And their instructions did not match the screens I was getting on Windows XP SP 2.\\nSo I called back again. And again. And again. \\nDespite being given a case file, each time I was asked the same questions, including what, exactly, is wrong. And each time I was told to do the same thing: Install from the CD. Reboot.

Reboot. etc.\\nIt would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the CD. A clearly designed website would be second best.

When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought.  She looked at the TV and said okay I'm ready turn it on.  I said \"it IS ON!!\" This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it.  The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different, but that's all it was, different.  It was NOT noticably better.  In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse.  I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that's not what I got it for).

       " <review_text>\\nI hoping to use the WGR101 to provide wireless, encrypted access to two laptops from a wired ethernet connection in a hotel. It worked fine in single-user, no encryption mode but that is not what I needed. I experienced severe problems trying to use it in single user mode with WEP or in multi-user mode with and without WEP. One or both laptops would lose the ability to connect to the internet at seemingly random intervals. Sometimes cycling the laptop wireless radio would restablish the connection, sometimes I had to reboot the laptops, sometimes I had to reboot the WGR101, and sometimes I had to reboot the laptops and the WGR101. Stay away from this product unless single user, unencrypted access is what you need\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nMy Sangean DT200V pocket radio failed after 2.5 years of infrequent use.  I kept it in a padded pocket of my briefcase where it experienced no significant shocks or temperature extremes.  It worked perfectly on the few occasions when I used it over the 2.5 year period, until yesterday.  The buttons, switches, and display still work perfectly, but only very faint white noise can be heard, whether via speaker or via earphone.  The volumn of the faint white noise is not significantly affected by the volumn control.  The batteries are new, and there is no corrosion from the previous batteries. \\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\n\\n\\n\\nPerhaps I got a lemon, but I feel wary of buying another DT200V for 2 reasons:\\n\\n\\n1.  From the day I got it, the power button was so sensitive that a tiny waft of air (no kidding) would turn it off (or back on) at whim.  Right in the middle of a song, or talk, this shortly became maddening.\\n\\nSince this is unacceptable for a $50-range radio; and since I didn't want to spend as much money mailing it to and fro as it was worth, instead of sending it back -(OH looking back, how I should have!)- I opened it up myself, and had to physically shave down the plastic underside of the on/off button where it touched the internal power switch.  As I couldn't conversely move the guts further from the button, this was the only solution.\\n\\nThankfully this worked, and the on/off button did not give me further problems after this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever,\\n\\n2.  Not many weeks or months of use in, the radio developed this habit of shorting out or something to where my pre-set stations just scanned as blank 'fuzz' (no station, not even 'intelligent' fuzz/crackle like it knew a station existed anywhere on the planet) and I could get zero stations of anything at all--not FM, not AM, and no TV.\\n\\nThis would happen right after turning the radio on, and I should note that I always used headphones (not the ones supplied; as with most, throw them away, they're not worth it).  It seemed to me through trial and error that just turning the radio on was fine, but the act of plugging in some headphones joggled some connection or shorted something out, and did this.\\n\\nI tried several different pair and types of headphones (some with noise cancelling switches, some without, and with these On and Off), and used the 'lock' switch on the radio both in the on and off position while plugging in my headphones (as the company I bought them from recommended turning the lock switch on when changing batteries, to prevent shorts), but nothing I have done has prevented this from eventually happening again...repeatedly.\\n\\nIt is really annoying when it does, as removing the batteries (which always will lose all your presets, by the way) and waiting several minutes rarely clears the short.\\n\\nWeirdly, the thing I've found which clears the short or re-makes whatever connection is messed up correct itself, is opening up the back (screwdriver required) and kind of pushing the guts (board) one direction or another, kind of scooting it (there's minimal movement available, though), and saying a little prayer and putting the whole thing back together again.  Most of the time, that has worked.  Occasionally, I've had to repeat the process 3-5 times before it will.\\n\\nSometimes it lasts several weeks before this'll happen again, other times, it happens multiple times a day.  The day I can't fix it (I don't even know what I'm doing that's fixing it!), I'll throw it across the room, against a wall, and I probably _won't_ buy another one.\\n(If I do, I'm keeping the receipt, NEVER opening up the back as it voids any warranty, and returning it (not for repairs--for a refund!) the split second it gives me any trouble of any kind.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor all this, I grudgingly say that it does have very good reception quality of FM (I almost exclusively listen to this), pulls the stations in nicely, and has very low amount of static.  When one particular station does, it's usually more the fault of distance, or we're getting out of range, or the batteries are very low- that's at fault.\\n\\nIndoors in a computer-saturated office-cubby environment and not near a window, though, I'd have to say, it has had some significant problems pulling in any more than 3-4 strong-signal stations without major static.  But your office environs may vary.  (Some are more electrical field saturated than most.)\\n\\nThe FM (musical) sound quality itself is good/decent, and I might say better than many...but my 1 criticism on it is a certain 'canniness' of sound quality (across various headphones I've plugged in).  It's lacking some fullness of the midrange, and warmth.  Also, the bass is not what it could be.  I'm not sure given its overall sound quality signature if the addition of a bass boost button would have helped it or not.\\n\\nFor me, clarity and volume have helped me ignore some of the lesser aspects of the DT200V's sound signature.  However, shopping for my next purchase, that will move up higher in importance\\n</review_text>,\n",

I setup the fixed IPs, and all the rest of the settings through the web interface, all seemed well. \\n\\nNote: I'm a network engineer, so the dual-fixed-ip recommendation [one for each segment] is actually pretty normal in other network bridging appliances. I suspect the MS game adapter simply performs the DHCP handshake better than this unit and that is why it is so easy to setup. \\n\\n\\nThen the weird stuff started. \\n\\nAfter having had this unit turned on for several days, I notice the connection would become slow and not quite as fast as when the Linksys is first turned on. Yet, the XBOX still shows the signal between 48 and 54 Mbps. Strange. \\n\\nI have reproduced this several times, booting the linksys device, then playing all kinds of games online for hours, running XBMC and playing media through the network perfectly. All is good for several hours, but come back the next day after leaving the Linksys on all day/night, turn on the XBOX, and the network connection is spotty again, but the link details show a full speed connection in the XBOX wireless interface details. \\n\\nA swift power cycle of the Linksys unit solves the problem immediately, but why should I need to do this? I suspect some NIC buffer is being filled on the Linksys and the power cycle clears out the unit's network buffers. \\n\\nIf anyone has figured out what settings to use to keep this thing stable, I am ready to listen, maybe I should select a G-only network and set the speed at 54 or 48 fixed, maybe that will work? \\n\\nAnyway, I am getting tired of power cycling this thing every day. \\n\\nGood Luck, \\nF. \\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI recently purchased a refurbished Toshiba Gigabeat F40 for about $150. Quite a bargain for a 40-gig MP3 player. However, upon reflection, I regret the purchase.\\n\\nThe Gigabeat hardware seems to be OK, with good sound quality etc. The major failing is with the included software. As other reviews have pointed out, the Gigabeat will only play encrypted tracks. The Gigabeat is supplied with Gigabeat Room application software to provide the necessary encryption. Gigabeat Room starts automatically when connected to the PC via the USB port. From the time the Gigabeat is connected till the Gigabeat Room application is displayed on the screen is 30 minutes. If you switch from viewing the Gigabeat file directory to the PC file directory, the application hangs. If you try to update your track library, the application hangs. I have yet to get  through a single operation from beginning to end without the program hanging. Every time the Gigabeat Room hangs, you have to restart the application, with yet another 30-minute wait to resume. The file directory on the Gigabeat is usually out of sync with what is actually present on the hard drive. Microsoft Media Player version 10 may also be used to synchronize the Gigabeat. I have a 35-gig library. It took Media Player 18 hours to encrypt and copy all 8100 tracks to the Gigabeat. In short, be prepared for a maddening and time consuming experience with this player. Software that gives error messages such as \"The Program Is Quitted\" and with such obvious fragility may have been expected in 1986 but is absolutely unreasonable in 2006.\\n\\nIn my estimation you would be much better off purchasing an MP3 player, even at greater cost, that can play MP3 files directly, with file maintenance provided by Windows Explorer and or Media Player.\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nThe ONLY reason i bought this unit when I saw it in the store was for the iPod controller feature.  I really looked forward to being able to control my iPod from the deck and hiding my ipod in my dash completely out of sight.  Boy was I disappointed!  The iPod adpater works and all... but barely.  It takes FOREVER to scroll through the songs, artists or albums.  Why the hell would Alpine put out a product that has an inferior scrolling mechanism and then lock you out of the iPod so you can't even select songs from the iPod itself?  I have over 3000 songs on my iPod... by the time I scroll to the song I want I've already reached my destination... and that's if I even find the song at all!  So now what I have to do is unplug my iPod, scroll to the song I want, then plug it back in. (Luckily the reciever continues to play whatever song was already playing when you plug your iPod in.)  But again... that defeats the whole point of having the controls built into the deck.  Bottom line, the iPod control feature flat SUCKS.  The deck features a \"quick search\" function... but it is uselss... it isn't used to search through artsts or albums... only individual songs and there's no way to skip 10, 20, 30 or 100 songs at a time... only 1 by 1... What's \"quick\" about that?   I have 3000 songs and hundreds of artists and albums and Alpine thinks I'm supposed to go through them 1 by 1???? Another annoying thing about this unit is that when you skip through songs while the iPod is playing, the display just says \"song up\" or \"song down\" instead of just showing the name of the damn song!  Who thought of that?  What possible help could \"song up\" be to anyone? Just show the name of the song while I'm skipping through... that makes more sense right?  There are a bunch of other problems I have with the practicalness of this unit when used with the iPod adapter and iPod... but the sound quality is great which is the most important thing... but then again... who cares if the sound is great when it takes you all day to find the song you want to listen to\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI bought an Alpine 9847 and the Ipod interface. I works but it totally hijacks your Ipod. The beautiful intuitve, fast controls on the Ipod itself are locked out and you can ONLY control the Ipod from the car stereo. It is therefore very hard to deal with especially if you have a large music catalog on you Ipod. It is very slow, not at all intuitive. Even after getting used to it it is no good. The info on artist, album or song title imports from the IPod very slowly. Turning the volume knob is equivalent to circling on the Ipod but one turn eqauls about 3 spots on the list unlike one circle on the Ipod which equals dozens of spots on the list. Therefore if you have a large catalog you have to spin the volume knob 100 times to get thru a long catalog list which takes forever........Very annoying, very slow, very cumbersome. If only it did not deactivate the normal controls on the Ipod itself. A better and much cheaper solution is to find a car stereo with some form of line in, either stereo mini plug or RCA jacks. The just connect directly and use the IPods own controls which are infinitely better. I replace an old stereo to get the Ipod option and am very sorry I did so\\n</review_text>,\n",

In addition, I agree with some of the other reviewers that a significant amount of label is wasted with each printing due to the empty space on either side that must be cut off.

       " <review_text>\\nI bought this item after seeing the almost uniformly good reviews including the one that says there is good Macintosh support.  Unfortunately the player does not work well with the Macintosh.  The included software often crashes and does not seem to be able to import DSS files.  The software can move the files between the recorder and the computer but the files do not appear in the software window.  The use interface is also fairly crude and looks as if it was ported directly from Windows 3.1.  The DS-2 appears to the finder as a standard USB disk and I have been able to copy the DSS files from the player to the compuer using the finder.  It is then possible to play the DSS files by double clicking them, but it will only play one file.  If you want to play another file it is necessary to completely quit the DSS player and relanch it.  Exporting the files to a format usable by other software such as AIFF is also nearly impossible.  There is an export function in the menu, when it is selected it asks were the new file should be saved but no file ever appears.  Unfortunately there is no other Macintosh software available to read or convert DSS files as Olympus refuses to allow others use the the format on the Macintosh.  Search of the internet reveals that others have found extremely painful ways of converting the DSS files such as playing the entire file and re-recording it with another program\\n</review_text>,\n",

I found that the uneven cord lengths are very irritating- especially if you like to use only one plug (like maybe at your desk at work). The weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite uncomfortable- even when sitting still.

The effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience (even when you are sitting stationary at your desk). It is similar to wearing a stethescope, which defeats the point of wearing in-the-ear headphones (which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise). I do not recommend these headphones, because of this stethescope effect- I could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses (they are after all designed to wear behind the head).

The partnership with Etymotic Research is evident.  Everything sounded great:  rock, grunge, classical.  The Sonys sounded really muddy while these had a really bright sound with good bass (when the seal was good).  Very balanced sound.\\n\\nCord/Construction:\\nI string my earphones through an REI One jacket, so this was more or less perfect length.  The cord is symmetric so it's not weirdly strung behind your neck like the Sonys, and the connection to the ear pieces is solid, not fragile-looking like the ER6.  The earphones connect to the replaceable eartips very tightly.  The included case is ridiculous though; it's way too bulky for portability.\\n\\nComfort/Fit:\\nSadly, this is primary reason I'm returning these.  Both the flanged rubber tips and the included foam tips were too big.  The foam models got the seal, but they were too big, so I felt an uncomfortable amount of pressure in my ear canals.

I called Netgear, waited on hold for 15 minutes, and then was connected to a gentleman whose English was not very good. I explained my problem about 5 times before he seemed to get it. He told me that the problem is that the product is not compatible with Win 2000 Server. I told him that I had never before encountered a piece of software that ran on 2000 Pro, but not 2000 Server (perhaps there are some), but he insisted that this was the case. I explained that, typically, installation programs that encounter and incompatible operating system would display a message to the user, and exit, rather than freezing and disabling the computer, but he held firm, and advised me that there was nothing he could do to help, and that he recommended that I contact my computer vendor so that they could restore my initial configuration. \\n\\nI went around and around with this fellow, then finally asked for his supervisor. After another 15 minutes on hold, another guy came on the line, who was pretty fluent in English. He explained his understanding of the situation, which was still wrong, and I explained the whole thing again to him. He had me turn the computer on and off, which of course I had already done several times, and check the monitor connection. After this analysis, he determined that the situation could not possibly have been the result of the frozen software installation that occurred just prior to it, and must be some other problem with my PC that had previously been working perfectly, that, coincidently, occurred at the exact same time as the software freeze. I expressed skepticism towards this explanation, and asked him if he would believe that if it was his PC. He said that absolutely he would, and reassured me that there was NO POSSIBLE WAY, (emphasis his) that his software could have caused these symptoms. \\n\\nSince I understood that it would be difficult for him to actually fix a computer in this state over the phone, I suggested that I could take it to a local technician, and send Netgear the bill for repairing my system.

It worked perfectly with my old Thinkpad, but not long thereafter I got a Thinkpad T60, thinking, \"Hey, universal means universal, of course it will work\". But no: SIX MONTHS after the T60 was introduced, Kensington STILL hasn't gotten their act together to produce a \"SmartTip\" for it. They haven't even added Lenovo to the list of manufacturers on their web site! All Customer Service can say is that they don't have one, they don't know when or if they ever will, and they suggest that I check back on the website someday if I still hold out any hope. So, I have a $100 brick on my hands. Very disappointing, Kensington.\\n\\nIt's really too bad: the unit is lightweight, sleek, and functional, and (unlike some reviewrs) I think the 5-inch cord was brilliant (and it doesn't get tangled up in my briefcase). The cables are much nicer than on my 70-watt iGo supply, and the connectors don't break like they did on the iGo. And it's not like there's some technical problem: the T60 needs 20 volts, 90 watts, well within the 24-volt, 120-watt capability of this unit.  However, six months delay in supporting a major business computer brand is just unforgivable, so I can no longer recommend it\\n</review_text>,\n",

The more you learn about video and audio, the more you'll avoid anything with the Monster label. Specifically, this s-video meets no NTSC, DVD or IEEE standard; it is common 30-ohm hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed, low-conductance connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding. Has a sharp image, but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from off-color skin tones to color blotching, dirty grays, burned highlights, murky shadows, noisy reds, and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds. Makes video test patterns look great, but who watches test patterns all day? Amazon offers many other brands at good prices, why waste your $$ on this stuff?

       " <review_text>\\nI bought this adapter along with the Linksys WRT54GL Broadband Router.  I managed to set them up and install them properly.  (The best advice I got from the \"Home Networking for Dummies\" book was to get a 100 foot Cat5e patch cable so that I could put my router in the place I where I wanted it, and hook it up with a wired connection first.  I actually only needed a 50 foot cable, and got it for $20 from a local electronics supply store.)\\n\\nSo I got everything up and running (remember to install your router first, and then your network adapter), surfed the internet for awhile, and then shut down my computer.  Here's where the trouble started....\\n\\nAs other reviewers have noted, the Linksys installation makes changes to your Windows XP configuration, de-activating the Welcome screen and the feature Microsoft calls \"Fast User Switching.\"  This happens with no warning.\\n\\nWhen I went to turn on my computer again, I got a new start-up screen for Windows, demanding a password.  I freaked out, because I don't remember ever setting a password for Windows.  I called Linksys, and was extremely unimpressed with their customer support.  The young woman seemed to be amused by my problem, and was actually laughing at me.  She began to start me through the process of completely re-setting the router to the factory settings (this would NOT have helped).\\n\\nWhat finally helped was figuring out (with no help from Linksys) that if you never set a password for your Windows XP logon, all you have to do is hit \"Enter\" at the password prompt.  That's all there is.  Linksys could have told me this, or better yet, warned before installation that these changes to Windows XP would take place and suggest setting up a User Password in advance.\\n\\nAnother gripe about this network adapter and the Linksys router--neither came with instruction manuals.  There is a 60-page instruction manual on the CD rom that comes with the product, but you'll have to print it out yourself (Do it before you install or try installing the product).  In the case of the router, I also had to do deep searching to actually find the instruction manual on the CD-ROM--it wanted to start up the Setup Wizard automatically and the instruction manual was not easy to access from the CD-ROM.  I guess this may be the norm now with computer hardware, but it still stinks.\\n\\nI do not recommend the Linksys WUSB54GC, primarily because of the unannounced changes it makes to the Windows XP system, and because of Linksys' non-existent or non-functional and rude customer support\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI have owned the TomTom Navigator 5 for almost a year now.  While the program is well thought out and provides a good function, it does not work well with my Tungsten T5.  I have contacted customer service 4 times now and they have always been helpful in trying to fix my issues (listed below), but to no avail.  \\n\\nSome of the issues I have had:\\n\\nAny time the software has to redirect or think, it locks up.  If I stay on the original planned route, it sometimes works properly...\\n\\nIn a 30 minute trip from Orange County to Long Beach, I had to pull over 7 times to reset my device after the software locked up.\\n\\nVoices lock up mid sentence giving a stuttering sound until you are able to pull your car over to reset the device.\\n\\nIn a 20 minute trip from San Francisco to Oakland the device locked up 5 times.  I finally gave up and called a friend to guide me.\\n\\nBear in mind, I have had no problems with my T5 in the 1.5 years of ownership...it is only with this software.  Customer service has acknowledged the problems and given solutions that have solved little to nothing.  \\n\\nIn summary, it's not worth spending the money to have to print out Mapquest directions to have when the device crashes...stick with Mapquest\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\n  Essentially once TomTom has your money they're finished with you . . . until you want to spend more money with them.\\n\\n  The product is okay. The map data is from TeleAtlas, a vendor to many of the map software producers. What makes TomTom different is its GUI (Graphic User Interface) that the user interacts with. It really is a work of art most of the time. The map presentations are rich and may be viewed as 3D or 2D. The planning interface is icon driven and easy-to-use. Unfortunately TomTom really didn't think it all the way through.\\n\\n  There are several irritants, all of which vie for first place. One is that TomTom doesn't give you the option of using its maps without a GPS. There are many instances where I know where I am begining from and going to and I don't need a GPS fix. TomTom ignores such desires and annoyingly keeps prompting for you to start your Bluetooth connection. There is one mode that you can use to plan a route without a GPS and it simply doesn't work very well, often informing you that TomTom can't route you from a point beginning on an interstate to another point further along the same highway. That's just plain dumb. This is a mapping application. If I want to use these expensive maps for walking directions without a GPS, I should be able to. TomTom certainly doesn't think so.\\n\\n  Another irritant is the documentation. Probably in an effort to make TomTom appealing to the casual user, the documentation is dog simple . . . and often wrong. It appears that they didn't update the documentation to the newest version.\\n\\n  Although you can load maps by region, TomTom makes no allowance for travelling from one region to another. You have to calculate your route to the ending point within one region and then begin it anew in the next region. Again, this strikes me as a silly omission. If you are in Wisconsin, which is one region, and drive to Minnesota, which is in another, you have to create two routes. Not bright.\\n\\n  There are a number of idiosyncracies, anomalies and bugs that drive me up a wall. However, overall, TomTom is still better than the competition. It computes routes quickly (when it is capable of figuring a route at all). Annoying, however, it tends to prefer expressways, regardless of your preferences. In a major metro area laced with expressways going in all directions, this can create some incredibly convoluted - and ridiculous - routes. Creating alternative and more logical routes is possible, but tedious.\\n\\n  The worst part of the TomTom experience is its customer support. Well, perhaps support is the wrong word for it. I encountered two problems installing the software. It was obviously that the tech support person was clueless and was simply guessing and grasping at straws. (I had resolved the issues before the rep called and already knew what the problem was.) The TomTom rep didn't listen, kept interrupting and when it was pointed out that he was contradicting the manual, he just kept moving. (The manual in at least one instance was correct and the rep wrong.)\\n\\n  The TomTom packaging itself arrived in broken condition. The rep denied it was their packaging, claiming that I must have bought a third-party repackaged product. Talk about insulting: I have the package in front of me with the TomTom labels, the whole works and this guy is telling me that my lying eyes are deceiving me?\\n\\n  A fax to TomTom management about my experiences has gone unanswered more than a week later.\\n\\n  TomTom is riding high right now but I suspect in a couple of years as competitors introduce better products with better support that TomTom will be history. It won't be the first company that offered a good-enough product without support and possesing contempt for its customers to disappear and it won't be the last.\\n\\n  I know that if I find a marginally better product with adequate support, I'd abandon TomTom in a flash.\\n\\nJerr\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nThe TomTom Navigator is a nice enough device, until you get to the Maps activation. The Maps activation? Why should I have to activate my maps if I have paid for the product? Good question, well, I activated these maps on one PDA, and within 2 weeks my PDA died and I had to obtain warranty service. Well, I decided that I would upgrade to a new device and then sell my old device when I got it back from the manufacturers (I tend to switch my PDA every 3-4 months anyway).\\n\\nSo I installed the maps on the new device and it asked me to activate. OK, I figure...no problem, I will be able to activate it 1...2...3 because after all, only I have the activation card/code. No such luck, TomTom wants PROOF that I have brought a new device? what kind of nonsense is that? What if I lost my PDA in 2-3 months? What if I'm a nut who likes to change PDA's every 3-4 months? What, you mean I have to show you proof that I switched? Isn't the fact that I have the activation card proof enough? I don't know too many people who pay $269 for a product and let other people use the activation codes.\\n\\nAvoid them at all costs. You will regret your purchase if you change devices frequently.\\n\\nOne other problem with this product...out of the box it is not 100% compatible with Windows Mobile 5 devices (most of the new Axims are WM5. You really have to break your back to install on these devices.\\n\\nAvoid\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\n   My company car has a built-in GPS unit and I have gotten to like it, sort-of.  I have gotten lost in a rental car trolling around Silicon Valley enough to get a portable GPS unit.  After some research, the Garmin iQue 3600 is what I ended up with and I paid about $700.  The unique feature of this portable GPS unit is that a PalmPilot comes integrated into the package.   I use a PalmPilot, so this GPS unit replaces my PalmV.    Installation was quite awkward, and getting it up and running was a chore.   I got the thing synced up and some maps loaded and have been using it for several months now.  It does do the job, fitfully, and has several glaring issues.  Most irritating, the Palm function and the GPS function are not seamlessly integrated.  If an address is entered in the Palm part and then route to this address is selected, the iQue 3600 makes you find the location.  But the address from the Palm section doesn't transfer cleanly into the find section and you must retype the address.  I'm left-handed and graffiti has NEVER worked for me all my letters are drawn backward.  The GPS can be engaged as soon as it recognizes where you want to go, but my unit takes a good 5-10 minutes to find the satellites when first exposed to sky.   This means that I must have a good idea what to do for the first 5-10 minutes.  Sometimes I just drive randomly until the GPS locks in and starts to issue navigation orders.  Also, the antenna must be deployed to get any GPS reception and must be forward enough in the windshield to see sky.  This is OK, except that the iQue 3600 doesn't tell you that the antenna has not been deployed.  \\n   The iQue 3600 does not work propped up on the passenger seat so a 5 pound holder is necessary to hold the unit on the dashboard.  If the antenna is not deployed, the iQue 3600 simply doesn't navigate and doesn't tell you why.  Worse, it acts stupid by going into a dangerous and unhelpful simulate mode.  If I ever figure out what that means, Ill tell you in a future post.  I figured out the antenna problem the hard way in an ice storm outside of Ottawa.  I'm a fan of GUI design, and I must say that the UI here is very, very bad.  Not the worse I have ever seen, but very bad:  non-intuitive, inconsistent, and arbitrary.  The FIND function/button has an entirely different function in the GPS section from the Palm section.  Of course, the same icon is used.  I cannot imagine grandma using this thing to navigate.  What little there is of the very pretty documentation is atrocious.  About 10 times more information is needed here.  It shuts down randomly on occasion for no apparent purpose (Battery savings maybe?).\\n   The secure digital card is too small (max of 256MB), so you can't put more than a few California counties in the memory.  Maps storage is managed with a rather hostile GUI.  This is not fatal, but is irritating.  I would rather put a 1GB SD card in the iQue 3600 and be done with it.\\n   The iQue 3600 burns too much power to be used as a portable, so it must always be tethered to the car or resting in the cradle.  I don't find the power issue to be a problem.  I understand that to get clear, bright screens it is necessary to use power.  I agree with the tradeoff here.\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI'm a longtime user of Wacom Intuos tablets and I was looking for something similar with wireless capabilities for my new dual 2.5ghz-G5. There were no wireless Intuos products available at the time of purchase, so I went with the Graphire Bluetooth. Unfortunately, the product leaves a lot to be desired and after a couple of weeks of use, I plan on returning it. The major problem lies with the pen--both in design and responsiveness. \\n\\nDesign: the Graphire series is cheaper than the Intuos, and there's a good reason why: the Graphire pen is thinner, lighter, and has no grip. If you have very small hands this might be acceptable; in my hand this feels like a toothpick. It's very difficult to manipulate a tool effectively when it doesn't feel like it has any durability. Additionally, the Graphire pen stand is little more than a piece of transparent molded plastic and slides around the desk whenever I put the pen back into it.\\n\\nResponsiveness: There is a half-second delay whenever using the pen to click in any finder-related options--opening windows, selecting files, etc. 1/2 second may sound acceptable, but if you, like me, use the pen for everything, not just drawing, believe me it is utterly maddening. On the other hand, the mouse behaves perfectly with no delay at all, so I know it's the pen and not my computer.\\n\\nThe tablet is attractive and the mouse works fine, but the bottom line is that it's more important for me to have a responsive, durable pen than a wireless tablet. If you've never used an Intuos you may not recognize the deficiencies, but for those who have, this is like going from a Mercedes to a Honda Civic. You'll get better gas mileage with the Civic but the Benz gives you the  best overall driving experience. I need the driving experience, so I'm going back to the Intuos--wire and all.\\n</review_text>,\n",

When there is a no-load, jiggling/adjusting the drawer sometimes (not always) fixes it, but only until the next time, and will not stop the freezing problems.

The more you learn about video and audio, the more you'll avoid anything with the Monster label. Specifically, this s-video meets no NTSC, DVD or IEEE standard; it is common 30-ohm hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed, low-conductance connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding. Has a sharp image, but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from off-color skin tones to color blotching, dirty grays, burned highlights, murky shadows, noisy reds, and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds. Makes video test patterns look great, but who watches test patterns all day? Amazon offers many other brands at good prices, why waste your $$ on this stuff?

       " <review_text>\\nI ordered this keyboard/mouse combo and it turned out to not be blue tooth, so I returned it.  I'm sure it would have been great if I had used it but my Mac has blue tooth and I thought I was getting a blue tooth kbd and mouse.   \\nI got an apple blue tooth keyboard instead and I found a logitech blue tooth mouse, which I also got.

       " <review_text>\\nI purchased this for my Intel iMac mainly because I was so frustrated with the Mighty Mouse.  I wanted something with two separate buttons.  I had tried the Logitech MX 610 (which I purchased as well for another computer) and thought that the ergonomic shape felt wonderful.  So, I purchased this desktop set because I wanted it to match my Mac and so I could have a proper 2 button mouse.  I figured the Mac keyboard could use improvement as well so the keyboard could come in handy as well.  In fact, I thought I would get added convenience since this was a keyboard designed for a Mac and had extra shortcut buttons.\\n\\nOther than having 2 separate buttons on the mouse, this keyboard/mouse combo has been an utter disappointment.\\n\\nFirst of all, the white doesn't quite match.  It's close, but just a touch too cream.  Also, there's just too much silver.  Especially on the mouse.\\n\\nSecondly, it doesn't have all the buttons the Mighty Mouse does.  There is no button to switch to the Widgets.  Luckily, you can press F12 on the keyboard.  Not quite as convenient, but still possible.  However, I have yet to find a button that allows you to switch between various open programs.  This is especially necessary if you have multiple web browsers open.\\n\\nThirdly, this mouse just doesn't work as well as other Logitechs.  It is too light, lacking the \"feel\" and a bit of the comforting weight that the MX 610 has when you move it around.  Also, the speed of the cursor is off.  No matter how I try to adjust the speed, it doesn't quite match the speed of the original Mighty Mouse.  It is either too fast or too slow.  I think part of it is simply OSX's lack of adjustability compared to [gasp] Windows for cursor speed.\\n\\nFinally, the keyboard is simply atrocious.  I don't even use it anymore.  It's packed up in the box and I plugged the original Mac keyboard back in.  The keys make a horrendous clatter when typing.  The pressure is nonexistant making touch typing just a bit more difficult than normal.  Also, the depth is quite shallow.  This is a desktop keyboard.  You can press the key down further on nearly all the laptop keyboards I've tried.  Also, the texture of the keys is far too smooth and uniform.  The raised dots to help you find the F or J buttons is too shallow.  I can't find the asdf an jkl; rows by touch.  I have to look.  As a touch typist, this is an unforgiveable sin.  It basically transforms you from a touch typist to a hunt and peck typer who has to visually find each key before you can hit it.  I'm typing on a Thinkpad whose laptop keyboard is far superior to this Logitech.\\n\\nSo, in short, save your money and avoid this keyboard/mouse combo.  I rated it a two because the mouse did have 2 separate buttons, unlike the Mighty Mouse, which is why I purchased this in the first place.  It hit my most basic requirement.  Otherwise, it really deserves a 1 star rating\\n</review_text>,\n",

I naturally refused, and was forced to keep my dead 4 month-old handycam, an unfortunate testament to some of Sony's now widely publicized QC issues.

       " <review_text>\\nWe drink a lot of coffee all day, every day.  So we decided to convert to a thermal carafe coffeemaker in order to keep our coffee hotter and fresher-tasting.  We first bought the 10-cup Capresso MT-500 which we loved except for the carafe which leaked slightly.  The coffee was perfect everytime and the taste great.  Unfortunately the control panel burned out about a year and half after we bought it.  So instead of another expensive Capresso replacement, we decided to try a Japanese model which we thought might be more reliable.  We have been using the Zojirushi for 2 weeks now and it works perfectly.  No leaks and it just feels more mechanically reliable than the Capresso.  Unfortunately, there is no water filter system in this model compared to others (we had taken this for granted and not checked for it).  And no reuseable metal mesh filter (that I could find on the market) instead of paper filters.  The water also does not seem as hot when it goes into the coffee grounds.  We are not sure why our coffee just doesn't taste very good anymore, but we definitely have noted a real sharp drop in taste quality.  Today, we pulled out our very old Krups ProAroma model and have noted a definite taste improvement.  We will use this and the Zojirushi thermal carafe until we get a new Capresso coffeemaker replacement.  Don't waste your money on this Zojirushi model unless you don't care about taste.  It was money thrown out the window as far as we are concerned.  Even mediocre coffee beans are too expensive to use with this machine\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nEveryone has already covered the basics, so here's the highlights:\\n\\nThe audio listening quality is poor, especially for 40mm drivers (which normally sound good with strong bass response).  This is due to the fact the speaker itself is far from the ear canal, since the outer padding contacts the side of the head instead of the actual speaker pad.\\n\\nThe headphones are heavy, which means a large amount of pressure is required to hold them in position.  They slide very easily off the head, and apply a lot of downward force on the ears.  I have a big head, and even made some slight modifications that increase the pressure, now they don't slide off, but are uncomfortable for more than an hour of use.\\n\\nAt first, the volume slider is stiff, but then becomes smooth.\\n\\nAfter 4 months of use, the mute switch is getting loose, I don't expect it to work 4 months from now.\\n\\nI really like the microphone portion of the headset, the angle is adjustable, and the volume is loud and clear.\\n\\nIn the end, these headphones have a good microphone matched with very poor quality headphones.  Next time, I'd grab the cheaper Logitech headset, where they are nice and light and the speaker pads make contact with the ears, not some large outer pad\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nI purchased this unit not for gaming, but for making PC to PC calls.  Here are my observations:\\n\\nPros:  \\n1. Sound quality of the microphone on the receiving end is reported by my friends and family as exceptionally clear.  Certainly much better than what you'd get out of a webcam.\\n2. Chord is robust and long.  Easily fits over my long desk to my CPU that rests beneath.\\n3. Controls are easy to use, although the mic on/off switch doesn't click into place like I'd expect it to.  It just slides back and forth.  I can see people accidentally turning it off.\\n4. Headphones produce good sound, although nothing extraordinary.\\n5. The mic itself freely rotates, so you can position it however you desire.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. First and foremost, if you've got a small head DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!!  My head is not big and these headphones ARE NOT ADJUSTABLE!  These headphones are so large that they're actually uncomfortable.  Their entire weight rests on my ears and I can't wear them for very long without my ears falling off.\\n\\n2.  These headphones are very heavy, uncomfortably so.  I've resorted to holding them up to my head and listening through one speaker to take the weight off my ears.\\n\\n3.  Perhaps having the airspace between the speakers and the frame keeps your ears cooler, but it still feels like I'm wearing a set of insulated ear muffs.  Chatting on hot summer days is limited to 10 minutes or less until I'm dying of heat exhaustion.\\n\\n4. You need to get a Y splitter if you wish to have these headphones and your computer speakers on at the same time. If you don't have front headphone plugs on your case this is an issue.  Otherwise you have to crawl under your desk and manually disconnect the headset from your motherboard jacks and plug in your speakers again.  Y splitters are only a few dollars but it's an accessory you will have to purchase, especially since front speaker ports on most computers can't be hooked up at the same time as your rear motherboard jack (and most people have their main sound systems plugged in with the rear one). Granted, this is more of a general microphone/headset combo issue than anything Logitek related, but if this is your first microphone/headset purchase then you should be aware of this problem.  I use onboard audio instead of a sound card, so I don't have multiple output jacks.\\n\\n5. These headphones are designed to rest behind your neck, not over the top of your head.  Unfortunately, the plastic beam is too heavy and pulls the speakers back, placing all the weight on your ears.  The plastic beam is also too short (and just!) to go over the top of my head for a more comfortable fit.\\n  \\n6. The design also doesn't make sense.  The beam is so short that it should rest behind your neck, yet the angle of the speakers through that air gap is better for wearing the beam over your head.  It's pretty uncomfortable.  If the headset was adjustable it would be fine!  The earpieces are just too huge!\\n\\nOverall I'm disappointed with these.  If you're under 5'10\" I say go with another model.  The hardware works great, but the design is terrible.  I'm returning these and purchasing an uglier, but more functional, set of smaller headphones\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nThe headset sits on the back of head, which is ok, however due to large ear rests it feals awkward and uncomfortable.

       " <review_text>\\nI have been using the Palmone Navigator with my TX for about eight weeks.  Most of my comments are based on a comparison with the built-in navigation system in my Lexus.  \\n\\nSoftware installation is fairly easy.  However, you need at least a 256 MB SD card to load more than a couple of states; I recommend a 1 or 2 GB card.  \\n\\nWhile the concept of a TX doubling as a navigation device is intriguing, the realty of it is rather sobering.  It is a cool toy, but if you have to plan routes for your job or any other meaningful purpose, this is NOT the right product.  \\n\\nThe pros are:\\n - Inexpensive in comparison to built-ins und stand-alone products\\n - Unit can be used in different locations and cars and even while walking\\n - One device serves multiple purposes\\n\\nThe cons are:\\n - It can take up to several minutes after starting the unit to acquire a satellite signal.  This is not the case with my car's OEM navigation system.\\n - The maps are outdated and not as precise as the OEM nav system:  I live in Phoenix, AZ and my neighborhood (built seven years ago) as well as most of the freeways I take to work and back don't exist on the software.  More recent updates are not available (I checked the Tomtom website).\\n - Navigation is often not precise enough (e.g. it tells me to make a left in 50 yards, when I have already passed the intersection where it wants me to make a left).  I never have this problem with the built-in navigation.\\n - Look-up function for addresses and phone numbers is clumsy and doesn't display actual address until you map it.\\n - It tends to freeze at least a couple times a day, requiring a soft reset.  \\n - Lost connections to the satellite receiver or lost satellite signals also tend to disrupt the navigation on longer trips with stops.\\n\\nOverall, the unit is too unreliable to be used as your only navigational aid.  If you need navigation to get to your travel destination, you are better off with a stand-alone unit.  I truly wish I had better things to say about this device since I really like the concept, but the reality just doesn't match the marketing.\\n\\n</review_text>,\n",

The smaller band, instead of keeping it secure, just loosens up rather than hanging on.\\n\\n3. The earpads, which were on wobbly stalks on the SRF-H3, to match the angle of the ears, are fixed on this model. so they push more on the rear edges of my ears, and push the headphones forward.\\n\\nThe quality of the electronics and sound don't do much good if the things are a pain to wear.

       " <review_text>\\nI can't say enough positive about Logitech mice.  This device, however, was a dismal disappointment.  The PC interface works well, and its knowledge of existing components seems impressive.  Unfortunately, that in no way translates into a good remote interface.  The ability of the unit to reliably turn on multiple components was poor, and, for those with video recorder boxes, very important functionality like the ability to access or schedule recording lists is not readily available (if its there at all, its hidden many keystrokes deeper than I care to know about).  Even when reverting to manual operation of individual components, changing which device is being accessed involves two keystrokes (as opposed to just one on less complex universal remotes--a much more irritating trait than one might think).  Overall, for day-to-day functionality I actually consider the barely-programmable remote that came with my Scientific Atlanta DVR vastly superior to the Harmony, which I've given up on after only a few days of forced use.\\n\\nConsidering the ridiculous pricetag, I strongly advise you save yourself a lot of money and your relatives a lot of frustration this year by steering clear of this sad study in user interface failure\\n</review_text>,\n",

They told me that there is no difference between the $119 warranty and the $499 warranty; they cover the exact same thing.  The girl I spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference.  Warranties are a tricky item to review, because it all looks good until you actually need it.

       " <review_text>\\nThe features, size, and design of this unit are what drew me in. But after just a few uses, I quickly came to realize that this was nothing more than cheap electronics wrapped up in an attractive, but completely unusable package. To start with, the unit is small - the smallest of its kind. But the bulky external mic makes the overall footprint just as large as some of the palmtop units that this was made to replace. Second, the unit has a built-in rechargeable battery that cannot be removed. So, when it crashes, which it does frequently, there is no way to \"cold-boot\" the unit by removing the battery. This is also a problem because it reduces the unit's true portability because you can easily get stuck with no remaining battery life and no AC power to recharge it. Then, what you have is a paperweight. Oh, and by the way, when you do have it plugged in to charge, the backlight is always on (even if the power is off). So forget about using this unit as a plugged in desktop recorder either.\\n\\nBut, all of this aside, the firmware simply does not work. It locks up incessantly and, with no way to reboot, you literally have to unplug it, wait for it to auto-power-off, and hope that you can start the machine up again. And, to add insult to injury, the body is a cheap Chinese-made piece of plastic with absolutely no meat on its bones.\\n\\nOverall, don't be taken in by the low price. Paying any amount of money is too much for a unit that doesn't work\\n</review_text>,\n",

I never realized how bad the wireless was on this router until this week - dropped connetion 3 times in 15 minutes today alone, while reading the Amazon.com reviews.  \\nMy desktop PC's  graphics card went down this past week and I had to RMA it... so about 10 days to send out and get a return.  I have always used a wired connection for my home desktops.  The wireless access was a 'it's there if I need it' novelty.  I started brining my IBM R51 laptop home from work so I could get online, VPN into work, etc..  This is the first time I have used my wireless consistently for more than a hour or so.\\nThe last 10 days have been rediculous to say the least.  I logged on my first day and lost connection 5-6 times browsing MSN and Yahoo.  At first I thought it might be channel interference since 2 other routers in range were using channel 11.  I went ahead and disabled the 108G feature since I had never come close to hitting that speed anyways, and changed the channel..  I used the IBM ThinkVantage software to scan my area for other wireless routers and picked a channel not being used.  I changed channels and I verified my signal strength before and after I changed, 95% signal strength. The connection is still getting dropped randomly.  Changed channel to another channel not being used in my area and verified signal strength.  No difference.  Scanned the networks again using the IBM ThinkVantage software.. theres my router, 97% signal strength @ 54Mbs.  unplugged router, modem, repaired my WINSOCKS with WinsockXP, rebooted PC.  I turned on my modem first until is was ready to go, then the router until it was ready, and then my PC (as per the netgear website)and yea, no difference in the connections stability.  The conection is still getting dropped randomly.  \\nI might expect this from a router thats on all the time and is getting tired from constantly being hammered. But I hardly ever used the wireless access (yes, wireless radio has been OFF).  After reading these reviews, I am pretty sure the problem wont go away.  \\nThe part that upsets me the most, I payed premium money for a product that I thought was premium.  If this had been priced (at the time) at bargain bin prices, I wouldn't of cared.. but it wasn't and i do.  The 'you get what you pay for' saying does not hold true for this product. \\nBuyer Beware\\n</review_text>,\n",

But the bad thing is so bad that the cord is useless.  There is nothing on the ends!  It's just a giant wire!  There aren't any connectors on the ends that I can use to plug the cord into my computer, or the router.  So I have a cord, but no connectors.

Maybe, if all you need is the cord (it's grey, by the way), and not the connectors, you might be able to use this.  Otherwise, it's completely useless.

Using them on the train I was able to turn down the volume on my music player a tad but a lot of the noise still gets through. I'm not an expert on these but I guess this noise cancelling works mainly on lower frequencies. Alot of the noise on the train is higher in pitch and thus gets through. The next thing I noticed was that with a cord coming out of both the left and right earphone you are limited in how you can put these on and take them off. My KOSS and Sony headphones and earbuds use the single cord to one phone and the connecting cord from there (or it runs through the headphone band). I realize I like this single cord feature very much. Again these Philips HN 110 don't have this. \\n\\nI also noticed that when the Noise Cancelling is turned on and the wind is blowing you can hear the wind as if it were amplified. \\n\\nAfter about a month and a half the battery compartment door latch broke inside.

Better than my hefty non-noise cancelling KOSS over ears or my stethascope like Sony ear buds but only by about 10% or so (just to put a number in their). Flimsy design. Cords from both earphones.

If you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an EMP strike, you're looking at the right cables.\\n\\nBut for nearly all consumers, these cables cost 4x as much as alternatives, with no real plusses. At the very least, you can pick up a mid-grade cable (Sony, etc) at a mid-grade price ($40) to get the increased sturdiness and the gold-plated connections. And over these products, the Monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding. Please do look up a cheaper alternative this time, and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean. You'll get much better results with these tools than you will worrying about $100 HDMI cables\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nWhat do they say about fools and money?\\n\\nHDMI uses TMDS which is a digital transmission system with built-in error correction. TMDS has been designed to work over cheap cabling and a $10 HDMI cable will meet the specification. If you spend 9 times more on this cable than another one then you have just wasted $80. That's all there is to it. \\n\\nYou don't need expensive shielding or gold plated connectors for a cable. The picture or the sound are not richer or more vibrant with a $90 cable over a $10. In fact the signal is identical. Let me repeat - HDMI (&amp; DVI-D) devices talk digitally with error correction. This cable and ones like it are for suckers only.\\n</review_text>,\n",

With that said I am not a bass junky; but bass and compression of the overall mix is what makes a sound a good sound.  I currently owned a pair of Sony MDR-EX81LP (that cost me 30-40 dollars a year ago) I am a medical student and I study all day and all night, but cannot have my music blasting.  Conversely I needed to have a nice isolation of my sound.  Comparing my old Sony to the new ER-6 that I just got, I am EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED with their performance.  I was expecting a great sound with minimal noise from the outside and get almost no response at the level that I studied with my old ear buds. To be fair remember that these are not noise cancelling, they are noise reducing.  There is no component involved here, they are basically really good earplugs with speakers in them.  My wife just ran the vacuum and I barely heard it.  The earplug reduced noise feature is great and comfortable; however my other ones (Sony earbuds) sound better.  A combination of the two would be great.  Keep in mind that this is my opinion and make your own based on why you are buying earbuds.  Environmental sound reduction is great, sound quality is not as good as some others.....choose your fault and pay attention to pricing. \\n</review_text>,\n",

The music sounds flat and with a hissy quality, almost monaural at times, and the volume seems a lot lower than the car's radio at the same volume setting. I had to turn the volume dial up quite a bit when playing satellite radio. The car's regular radio sounds much better than satellite radio if using wireless reception with any of the radio receivers, IMO. Besides, there are plenty of annoying ads and interruptions on XM radio as someone mentioned in another review.\\n    \\nI thought about having the units professionally installed so that my wife and I wouldn't have to use the poor sounding wireless FM technology, but realized that both family cars have very expensive navigation systems and I didn't want the vehicle's factory warranty voided if some installer got inside our car's dash and accidentally messed something up.\\n\\nSo about two month's ago, after several months of off-and-on use of XM radio service, I called to cancel my subscriptions. I had paid for a six month subscription for both receivers when I joined. As I expected would happen, when I called them to cancel, I was on the phone for allloooooonnnng time waiting for a customer service rep. Finally, I got to tell the rep all my relevant account information so I could cancel the service only to be put on hold and transferred to their \"special\" customer service department for cancellations where I was \"accidentally\" disconnected and had to call back and start all over again.\\n\\nFinally, after another long call to them, I was able to cancel my service.....or, so I thought. Yesterday, I was looking at my September credit card bill and saw that XM radio had charged my credit card for the next six months despite the fact that they assured me that my two accounts would be closed. \\n\\nI called my bank and had them reverse the charges and I may have the bank issue me a new credit card with different numbers in case XM tries to charge me again six months from now.\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI've had a set of these batteries for a year or two now. The last few times I've taken them out for vacation use in camera, I've had the same problem: I charge two sets (one Kodak and one these Energizers) when I put the camera away. A few weeks later, I go off on vacation. The Kodak 1600mAh set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before. The Energizer 2500mAh set might last me half a day, having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use.\\n\\nAfter missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries, I'd had enough.

I was upgrading from my previous set of 1600mAh Rayovac NiMH AA batteries that were still going strong after 2 years. When I saw the new energizer 2500mAh rechargeables I was excited to purchase them thinking they would last longer than my old 1600mAh Rayovacs.  Boy was I wrong!\\n\\nFor 2-3 months, the 2500mAh energizers worked well. A charge lasted about 6-7 hours in my portable GPS unit. I was getting roughly 5.5-6 hours on my old 1600mAh Rayovac AA's. My GPS unit is spec'ed for 6 hours on a pair of AA's so the new 2500mAh energizers seemed to work flawlessly.\\n\\nNow they work okay and seem to be getting worse each time I charge them, appearing to hold less of a charge each time.  For the last month or two (4th &amp; 5th month after their initial purchase) I'll be lucky if I can get 4-5 hours of use out of them in my portable GPS unit. I now get roughly 3.5-4 hours of use out of them.  I pulled out and tried my old 1600mAh Rayovac AA's and once again got approximately 5.5-6 hours of use out of them in my GPS unit - and my trusty Rayovacs are just over 2 years old!\\n\\nI thought I might have had some defective energizers but I can't seem to get any pair of combinations to hold a decent charge. Charges just don't seem to last - it's really disappointing.  I am going to look at another brand for high capacity 2500+ mAh NiMH batteries to replace my 1600mAh Rayovacs. Would be great if the energizer could hold its charge. But because they don't, I do not recommend the energizers to anyone\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI bought the Zboard and was sorely disappointed in it's playbility, efficiency and value for several reasons:\\n\\n-The left buttons, which are the feature of the keyboard, are based on a mirroring system.  You experience keyboard lag at times because the board has to interpret the button presses based on the zboard program, then the game.  I personally had to press some buttons twice, or even three times in order for that command to register.\\n\\n-The left buttons cannot be configured to your game, you must configure the game to it.  The templates for different games cannot be modified, all it does is change the button configuration.  There are no patches for configuring the keys to how you want it.\\n\\n-According to the website, the top buttons for media can only be used with windows media player.  If you use winamp, itunes, or anything else it wont work.  \\n\\n-You cannot program any macros into any of the buttons.  If you are looking for a keyboard that can autofire or program keystrokes this isn't it.  \\n\\n- The numpad is configured differently than a normal keyboard.  This can actually be a good thing if you like having a compacted pad.  I found it frustrating since I put attack commands on the numbers, and would press the wrong one sometimes because of the layout.\\n\\nI experienced a lot of frustration with this controller while pvping in world of warcraft.  The top buttons on the left side of the board give you access to a bigger arsenal of spells and abilities when programmed right.  The problem is remembering how zboard configured the button layout.  I would constantly get wailed on because a button wasn't where I originally remembered it to be.  This forced me to sit in the key bindings menu to configure the buttons to where I could remember.  After completely revamping my bindings, I gave up, restored my defaults, and used a regular keyboard instead.\\n\\nThere is nothing gaming enhancing about this keyboard beyond having an accessory on the left side that looks cool because the buttons are grey and red and contoured to your hand.  \\n\\nTo achieve the same effect as the zboard, turn your current keyboard slightly to the right and enjoy.\\n\\n</review_text>,\n",

The first problem occurred on the New Jersey turnpike. I was supposed to use the turnpike from start to exit 18 and at exit 4 we stopped to eat. The unit said I was off course because the rest area was 100 feet from the highway. However when we returned to the highway the unit could not chart the course any more. It said I was doing 95 miles a hour when i was doing 70, and it would lose satellites and go searching for them in the middle of the highway no obstructions of any kind anywhere. I even pulled over at exit 6 and we waited for 20 minutes to see if we just needed to stop the car for it to do the job. It did not recalculate our course until after exit 18 some 100 + miles from when it acted up. We even tried a full restart and cancel route and retried again from the address book and from direct typing the information again. About 1 mile from our destination it worked for 2 blocks and was lost again. Then after 2 more blocks we found where we where going. We often get lost on this trip this is why we purchased the unit. Then on the trip from the Bronx to Long Island a 30 mile trip it stopped 5 blocks into the journey and was recalculating. I had to call the people we where visiting and they directed us by phone. However about 1 mile from their place it started working again. We used it on long island with no trouble at all. Then on  trip back to the Bronx it worked pretty good only losing its position once on a major highway no trees or obstructions. Then on our way back from the Bronx to long Island it was lost half the way finding position and calculating . The same exact way we went in both directions but it was clearly not right leaving the Bronx. On our way back to Maryland it operated pretty good after a short stretch of lost signals and redirecting and we used exactly the same roads in both directions. I did update the software to the new 1.2.0 days before we took the trip.  \\n\\nAlso charting the 212 mile course to the Bronx NY took close to 20 minutes, then the extra destination to Long Island a 30 mile addition took the Iway 350 30 or so more minutes. I figured with all that time the trip home calculations would be faster but I fell asleep after waiting  over a hour for it to complete the task. I feel this is one issue the unit has. Longer trips take so long to calculate so when it thinks your off track it takes forever to chart a new course. On short runs under 20 miles it was very fast.\\n\\nI returned the unit and got a Garmin C530. The C530 is a very nice unit fast in every respect.\\n</review_text>,\n",

Four of the eleven lost episodes were because newly constructed highways were not recognized. Five were due to the unit reacting too slowly in rapid turning sequences.

Quarrel (they are tough!) with the guy who could not care less about the fact I got him lying, or that the product description is wrong. Ok, patiently I freed up 10Gb from hard drive, try again, exactly same problem. The only thing they could offer in the end was a replacement.

And I wouldn't trust it for Windows XP either.\\n\\nThere are other Ethernet adapters out there by 3COM, Belkin, Linksys, SMC, and Xircom that work flawlessly with Windows 2000/XP by companies that will respond to your questions. Go get them. Avoid the FA511\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI have been a DVR user through Cox Cable for approx. 1 yr, and have always been disappointed.  I have kept my eye on Tivo for some time, and when my DVR box went out for the 2nd time, I decided it was time to try Tivo.  I got a refurbished Series2 DVR that was free for signing a 1 yr commitment for $12.95 per month. \\n\\nI received the Tivo only 2 days after I ordered, very impressive since I didn't pay to have it shipped that quickly.  The setup was reasonably straight forward.  I had heard so much about Tivo that I had very high expectations, and here are the problems I encountered that surprised me:\\n\\n1)  My first mistake was not recognizing that you have to get a Dual tuner unit to be able to record 2 seperate programs (DVR does this automatically).  So I ordered the wrong unit.  To be honest, I don't see how this service is very useful at all with only a single tuner, my family relies on dual tuners A LOT.  I am shocked that Tivo even offers a single tuner system, to me it's like a tricycle compared to a 10 speed, a dual tuner is so much more useful.  \\n\\n2)  I thought I would be able to hook up a wireless receiver to connect to my home network.  No, you have to buy theirs for $40 to $50.  Since I didn't know that, I had to rely on the phone line option.  This really stinks, it is very very very slow.  I spent 2 hrs trying to download one days programming, the system kept getting interuppted during download (yes I disabled call waiting).  \\n\\n3)  When you use the online program guide, it covers up the entire screen.  My Cox DVR puts the TV in upper right corner (approx. 1/4) asnd the rest of the screen lets you see the guide.  We use this all of the time to see if there is anything better on, but that won't work so well with Tivo.  Plus, scrolling up and down is painfully slow, the screen takes for ever to refresh.\\n\\n4)  Similarly to item 3 above, when you review recorded programs the show you are watching is turned off completely, you can only see the Tivo guide.  Again, Cox DVR lets me look at my list and delete files etc.. all while my TV program stays visible in the upper right corner.  \\n\\n5)  Remote wouldn't work with my 42\" Akai plasma.  I can't fault Tivo too much on this one, none of the universal remotes seem to work with this TV for some reason.  \\n\\n\\nI did love some of the Tivo features and wish my Cox DVR had them:\\n1)  Wishlist\\n2)  Tivo Suggestions\\n3)  Can access your Tivo through internet\\n4)  View photo's through Tivo.\\n\\nIn the end my items # 3 and 4 were things I just couldn't get past, so I returned my Tivo.  They were friendly and helpful and I really wanted to like this product, but in my opinion it's not able to compete with the speed and power of the Cable companies DVR. \\n</review_text>,\n",

As a wired router, this works well enough. It connects four computers to the internet. Just don't do anything to intense with it, and you should be fine. I noticed that when I view video media, the connection totally freezes.

Howver, BEFW11S4 has a MAJOR problem, and a rather common one at that. Specifically, it locks up. It does so frequently. I have to unplug the router at least once a day, and frequently twice, to deal with it locking up. Can't even access the administrator screen, and even hitting the reset button isn't enough to fix it. Wireless isn't too useful when you have to physically walk to the unit multiple times a day, is it?\\n\\nThe problem seems to lie not in the hardware, but in the firmware (the software that runs on the router). If Linksys would release reliable firmware for this router, I'd give it 4-5 stars. But until they resolve the issue that wires down their wireless modem, I can't possibly justify giving the BEFW11S4 more then two stars\\n</review_text>,\n",

That worked at first, but the problem persisted so I reprogrammed, but to no avail. Eventually I narrowed it down to the remote unit. Even with the remote RIGHT NEXT TO THE IR Transmitter, it now does not work most of the time. Of course the real problem now is that all my av stuff is in a different room, so standard IR remotes (why do they even make those still????) are out of the question.

I don't think it has ever left my office and I don't tend to put items on top of the wire that might crush it.

       " <review_text>\\nI purchased this in the hope that I would be able to record verbal messages to myself, creative thoughts and ideas, etc. It does an adequate job of that. I had also hoped I could use it as a simple player, to download affirmations and such to listen to throughout the day. This it won't do, and it was not clear to me from the information here and on the Olympus site that it would not function this way.\\n\\n First, even though it records wav files, it does not let you handle them well at all. To transfer recordings to your computer, you have to install special software (included), but you cannot transfer wav files back to the recorder (according to the software guide). If you want a recorder/player to function easily like that, you should go for the more expensive ones that allow you to use them as a USB flash drive (like the Creative Zen series). I did not install the software, as it offered nothing other than the simple transfer of a recording to my computer. I can record directly to the PC with much higher quality, so why bother? Noise recorded in a high quality format is still noise. It makes more sense to simply repeat anything I record on the Olympus and record it directly to the PC.\\n\\nSecond, the sound quality is not great. Given that wav files are what are used on CDs, one would expect more than what this device delivers. It is noisy on either of the mic settings, and I would have to describe the sound quality as medium. Don't expect high fidelity. This is a voice recorder for recording quick notes and not much else. Even analog tape would be better for most things. I may be fussier than most about this, having some professional background in audio, so the sound quality may be okay for most people. People have gotten used to lower standards in just about everything.\\n\\nFinally, playback was very disappointing to me. It has only the simplest playback features. It plays, pauses, fast forwards, and reverses, period. You cannot repeat either a single recording or portion of one, and you cannot create any kind of list to specify only certain files to play. It plays (manually) one recording at a time and that is it. You cannot set markers to fast forward or reverse to (like chapters on a DVD), and searching through a recording of any length is a major pain. In fact, this recorder is defined more by what it cannot do than what it can do. It is well built physically, although it is definitely designed for small hands, and can be a bit uncomfortable to use if your hands aren't small.\\n\\nIf all you want is to record medium quality voice, this will work fine. Don't expect it to record music or anything like that - you will be disappointed. Think of it as the audio version of a $20 digital camera. Cheap, quick, grabs the image, but no frills at all. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. \\n\\nI am usually very happy with Olympus gear, but this is definitely below their usual standard. Unless your needs are very spartan and smple, I would recommend looking at more capable devices\\n</review_text>,\n",

Buttons are labeled, organized, and layed out confusingly.  For example, why not have an \"alarm interface\" which would include all of the alarm modes and features, and maybe a \"radio interface\" which would include all of the radio functions/settings.  You would really understand how confusing this is if you were to actually go through the process of operating this alarm clock.  But really, don't do it, make the smart choice.\\n\\n3.  Too many features/modes.  I understand some people prefer all of the different features, but I wanted a simple alarm clock with a buzzer/radio, and clock.  Of course all of these special modes are set as the default, so it is a pain to try and configure all of the settings to a simple mode.  So for those who want a simple alarm clock, definitely DO NOT GET THIS!!\\n\\n4.  The button handling event is flawed.  For example, sometimes when I push a button, it does not handle the event (the device doesn't think that you pressed the button).  So I would have to press the button again and check to see if the radio handled the button input correctly.\\n\\n5.  It is very slow when holding the button down and waiting for the alarm clock to increment up and down.\\n\\n6.  Radio reception is very poor.  I have another radio right next to it that gets much better reception than this clock.\\n\\n7.

I called Escort Radar and was told \"If you let the car power up the unit when you start the car, the voltage can be all over the place and the unit gets confused. You must first start the car, and then use the thumbwheel to turn on the detector.\" It makes some sense, but if this is really the case, why don't they put those instructions in their manual? After trying this many times, the unit was \"still confused\", so I returned it for a replacement.\\n\\nMy second detector worked for maybe thirty minutes before the same thing happened. This time Escort Radar told me \"if you leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter over night, this has been found to cause problems.\" Well my lighter power goes off when I turn off the ignition, so this doesn't apply. Escort Radar also told me that \"excessive heat\" has been causing them problems. Now we have had a few days of 100\\ufffd heat, and I'm sure the car gets hotter parked in the sun, but the design engineers should have accounted for these conditions plus some margin when you design something that is supposed to work in a car. It gets a lot hotter in other parts of the country. There are no warnings in the manual about not using it above 90\\ufffd or leaving it off in a hot car. You wouldn't design a ski that doesn't work below 35\\ufffd, would you???\\n\\nThe most troubling part of my conversation with Escort Radar service department was they told me Amazon is not an authorized reseller, and they have no idea where they are getting the units from.

The cloth wrapped cords seem like a nice feature for making them a bit more rugged, but I don't like the way the cords are arranged which create this loop that you put your head into (combined with the stronger cord, better not wear them around machinery since getting them caught will likely result in something a bit more painful than just having the earbuds yanked out of your ears)\\n</review_text>,\n",

Their 'surround-sound' HE-592 phones don't fit well either.\\n\\nOn the phone Philips told me to buy a part at RadioShack to resolve my problem.  They couldn't give me an RS part number because \"it isn't their product\" but they recommend that over selling me or sending me  replacement ear pieces.  According to them this problem was all my fault, I should have realized it sooner, saved my receipts &amp; packaging an returned them within 30 days.\\n\\nFrom a technology standpoint the electronics are outstanding for the size and price.  I like the performance of the phones on planes, trains, etc.  They really work well but I am amazed that Phillips would risk losing customers over pennies worth of silicone.  It is a shame Philips can't do better with the customer touchpoints like the ear piece design, their phone support and part replacement policies.\\n\\nTake a look at Shure's products.  Shure sells replacement foam and triple flange sleeve ear pieces for their products.  If you are in the same boat with me and like these except for the fit I think the triple flange sleeves may work as a replacement for the stock Phillips ear pieces\\n</review_text>,\n",

She normally uses the IPod earbuds which are uncomfortable to her.  However, the noise canceling out weighs the sound quality so she prefers to use these earbuds over her Ipod buds riding a crowded train or bus.\\n\\nHopefully I can find something affordable that has good frequency response.

Of course, after less than a month one of those earbuds fell off and now I can't use these earphones until I find a replacement somewhere, which is proving to be troublesome. Super. I didn't buy these on clearance at Target so that hurts my pocketbooks and I am very ANNOYED right now.

       " <review_text>\\nI have had this phone for about three years. I bought it primarily to use it as a good quality speaker-phone (with mute) for long conference calls. It was quite expensive (I paid $200 to get it) but here are what I have found to be its shortcomings: No caller-id display. This just baffles me. I get caller-Id on all other phones in the house except this one. I have tried every possible varient (resetted settings, disconnected other phones, etc.) but nothing works: I always get \"NO ID MESSAGE\" on the LCD. The second major shortcoming is that called-parties often complain about the feedback on the speakerphone. One way to reduce that is by lowering the volume significantly, but that sort-of defeats the purpose of having a good speakerphone. Another minor shortcoming is that the phone requires to be powered even though it is a corded-phone (hence will not work in case of emergencies). Finally, two connect two lines you have to use an ugly adapter. One good thing about the phone is that it looks quite good, has a professional appearance, and claims to have a duplex-speakerphone.\\n</review_text>,\n",

I thought I was listening to a 70's era cassette it was so bad!  I have a high end Sony/Infinity system and the poor sound is very noticeable.  In desperation (and checking to make sure my amp was working fine) I plugged in my Apple dock from my 4th Gen Photo 60gb and the standard Apple AV cable.  The sound problem disappeared, and was crystal clear.\\n2.\\tThe menus to not work properly.  My Nano 5gb seems to work OK, but my 60gb 4th Gen Photo does not.  The menus are rather slow, and the artist, or album, or song titles disappear at random.  Sometimes you can back up a level on the menu and you will see the data, but mostly it is just blank.  The cursor will scroll down as though there is data there, but nothing shows on the screen.  You can play the music from the blank screen, but it is pot luck as to what you will play as you cannot see any titles.  I like the idea, but VERY, VERY frustrating.\\n3.\\tThere is NO support at all from the DLO website. It just lets me download a PDF of the manual or to buy more accessories.  I did not even bother contacting them due to all the problems.   I am not impressed.  \\n4.\\tThere also all the other problems listed elsewhere, too light and build quality poor, annoying power LED on front, no artwork on TV menu etc...\\n5.\\tSo basically, it is WAY too expensive.

Now I start every morning with a \"boy I hate this thing.\"  Why? well here are few reasons why: You cannot read the numbers unless you are within 18\" and to get a backlight you must depress \"any button\"---not a bad idea but horribly executed.  The backlight lasts four seconds--way too fast in the night and \"any button\" is a lie because you can't press \"stop\" nor the \"on\" for radio or cd without starting a whole other process which you then, in the dark, have to figure out how to terminate.  The cd player spends more time \"reading\" your cd than it does playing it.

Since I work from home, this wasn't an option at the time. I'm not a tech guy, I don't care much for gadgets, but I'm not stupid either, and I couldn't even get this thing set up without calling support due to lack of documentation and the assumption that everyone buying this router uses some version of Windows--I don't, I have an iMac. Once set up, the router worked fine for about a month, and then I started experiencing connectivity issues. I called support again and they figured out some issue with 'mac cloning' or some such, reset my static IP, and all was well for another week, when the same issue--losing connection with the router after 10-20 minutes online--arose again. So I called support AGAIN, got a guy after 7 minutes, but he directed me to their website to download a firmware update, and then basically hung up on me. Unacceptable. So I called back, sat on hold for 40+ minutes before being disconnected without ever speaking to anyone. Finally, after a third try, I got someone on the line and he got me to the firmware and helped me install it via their web interface, only for me to experience the same connectivity problem the very next day.

During the trip, there was quite a bit of interuption from hillsides and tall trees in the Pacific Northwest. I kind of wondered how well the reception would work in the city. Once I got out of the NW, I had no problems picking up a signal unless I was in a long tunnel or deep valley. \\nI did notice the unit did get hot during the trip and I think that is why it is acting the way it is now (two months later). \\n\\nIt works fine when first turned on, but after 15 minutes, the signal flutuates and at times, no signal is received. The tech support said that I needed to check the wires, but since it is 'recently' installed and it doesn't happen when first turned on, I'm ruling it a receiver problem.\\n\\nThe unit is placed just below the radio head and has been exposed to direct sunlight when parked. I'm sure it didn't help.\\n\\nI'm currently looking for a better unit and XM said they would transfer the remainder of the account to the new radio without inducing an activation charge.\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nHave you ever heard the saying that something would cost you \"an arm and a leg\"? These cables cost that, your first son, and bidding rights to your estate. Don't get me wrong- Monster makes great cables. Let there be no confusion on this point. But they're just incredibly expensive, and this is made much worse with these cables.\\n\\nSeveral people have pointed out that the digital signal on HDMI cables must adhere to error-correction and certain standards (even a $10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production)- and this is largely true. Unless BluRay implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future, there's really very little difference between HDMI cables. Yes, the gold-plated pins and other features will improve your connection a bit, but the improvement will be far less than you'd see between any other \"cheap\" versus \"designer\" cables on the market.\\n\\nBut Monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference, and that's worth mentioning. This cable is built sturdy, so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it. And the shielding isn't just the usual electrical shielding- Monster cables are toughened to the point that I wouldn't doubt if they're certified against nuclear fallout. If you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an EMP strike, you're looking at the right cables.\\n\\nBut for nearly all consumers, these cables cost 4x as much as alternatives, with no real plusses. At the very least, you can pick up a mid-grade cable (Sony, etc) at a mid-grade price ($40) to get the increased sturdiness and the gold-plated connections. And over these products, the Monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding. Please do look up a cheaper alternative this time, and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean. You'll get much better results with these tools than you will worrying about $100 HDMI cables\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nFrom cellphone and also the pager era I began my love affair with Motorola.  Don't need to read much farther into my review to get to the meat of it.  Sometimes companies make a lousy product even though they have others that are great!  Don't Buy These!  They fall into the former category  \\n\\nI needed them quickly (to give my in-laws time to practice using them before we went on a cruise) so when I went to their house for the weekend I bought them from the hated \"Best Buy\".  I am returning all 4! (2 sets of 2 handsets).  Here was my experience:\\n\\nI went in and saw the Midland and the Cobra along side the Motorola.  Not knowing much of Midland, but recognizing Cobra from their history with low-end phones and electronics, I opted with the very stylish Motorola T6500R's.  I know.  Big Mistake!  I am a computer programmer and very intelligent, but when confronted with products I do not undestand, I go for the brand name.  Which is something that can be forgiven if, as now, you find out what the problem is and correct it.\\n\\nI took them home and recharged them.  First things first:  The feel in your hand.  EXCELLENT.  They feel as good as they look.  I purchased these to go on a cruise to the Mexican Riviera and to maintain contact both on the boat and in the ports: Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and Cabo san Lucas.  We wanted to make sure we did not \"lose\" my in-laws (really!  I mean it!  No, really ....) \\n\\nAnyway. Charged them up and turned them on. They come with a plastic-encased group of 3 AA rechargable batteries that fit nicely (and only one way--they are keyed) in the dual-purpose battery compartment.  This is nice: if you are out and running around and your charge goes down, simply buy 3 AA alkaline batteries and go on your way.  There is no problem if you forget you have the NORMAL NON-RECHARGABLE AA batteries in the case if you put it in the charging stand.  Unlike other units, the physical metal conductors to charge the battery pack are actually built into the pack, not the handset.  If you put it batteries, the charger makes no connection to the handset. If you put in the rechargable battery pack, 2 silver contacts from the battery pack  contact the charging stand and VOILA the unit charges.  Fitting the handset into the recharger is a nightmare, though!  It must be generic and able to fit several different Motorola products (production outsourced to Giant Int'l Ltd--so if you thought this was a genuine Motorola built item, you are mistaken.  The entire Talkabout line are outsourced for production) as the dual-compartment charger has 2 inserts in each compartment and no indication of which one to use for the T6500R's.  I am a smart person though so I chose the one that looked like it best fit and inserted it.  Then I attempted to insert the T6500R's.  I say attempted because the bottom of the handset is rounded and thus does not seat well in any direction.  After you get it to EXACTLY the right position (look on the charger to watch for the LED to light up) the the hard part (of charging, that is) is over.\\n\\nNext item: Bad red LCD backed screen.  Hard to read in ANY light and impossible in the sunlight.  Settings were easy enough.  Channel, sub-channel, vibrate, NOAA broadcasts, etc.  However, the advertised QT (ensures no one can talk through your handset unless they are using a compatible Motorola handset) does not work unless you hit the PTT (push to talk) button (or the CALL button), wait about 3 seconds and begin speaking.  My in-laws are new to technology and are used to experiencing walkie-talkies when their kids were young.  Therefore this is unusual.  They automatically want to push the button and talk.  So, the first part of what they say is immediately lost. \\n\\nI say \"first part\".  I am assuming I actually caught a portion of what they said.  This brings me to the second major flaw.  This unit contains a HORRIBLE speaker.  If the volume is too low then you can't hear it.  Too high and it is garbled beyond your ability to understand it.  We were really hard-pressed to find a happy medium.  AND, in a noisy room, it would've been impossible to hear anything.\\n\\nSome merchants list these as 5 mile radios.  The packaging says 10.  The 1 watt GMRS suggests about 5-10.  We got less than 1.  Directly over a lake. In vehicles on the I-5, we drove less than 2 miles from their house  (which is DIRECTLY ON the interstate) and got no signal.  \\n\\nI got back to my house in San Jose (on top of Communications Hill...the largest \"hill\" in the area) and could not communicate to my spouse less than 1/2 mile away while he was coming up our road!\\n\\nSince the weekend, I have spent all my extra time on Amazon.com and Consumer Reports reviewing all the offerings.  (the latter, Consumer Reports' reviews are from July in 2002!) So, I think I am going to return these and purchase the Midland 5 watt GXT500's from Amazon.  Remember, doubling the wattage (in this case MORE than doubling) does not give double the signal.  As another others have stated, increasing wattage increases only another portion of the distance--ie: 2 watts to 4 watts does NOT double the distance the signal can reach.)\\n\\nHope this reveiw helps you\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nWhen realtime traffic monitoring came to my city, I immediately started looking at solutions to help my wife's daily business driving (2-500 miles weekly, crisscrossing a 50-mile area through major traffic routes). I quickly settled on an automotive GPS with realtime traffic monitoring. There are not yet many choices in this area, so the options boiled down to this unit and the Garmin 2720. (These use FM radio for the traffic info; the XM-radio units like the TomTom 700 and Garmin 2730 had unacceptably high monthly costs since I don't want XM radio.)\\n\\nI chose the Cobra for its large screen and positive reviews in areas that were important to me. Its flawed routing ability was not a major issue as it was to be used in a well-known region. Address lookup and traffic monitoring were the primary needs.\\n\\nIn short, I don't know much about how the Cobra performs because I was only able to use it for a few short test trips. This is because the mounting hardware is one of the most deficient pieces of engineering I have ever encountered in higher-end electronics gear:\\n\\n- The only mounting option is via suction cup, which in tests would adhere reliably only to nearly flat glass. A stick-on disc for attaching the suction cup is also provided, but I did not attempt to use it and would not trust it to be able to hold this heavy (1.25 pound) unit over the long run. If your vehicle does not have a flat section of windshield in a convenient location, you will have very few options for mounting this unit.\\n\\n- California law prohibits attaching things to the windshield, meaning that California users either need to risk a minor ticket or find an acceptable alternate mounting point. (Good luck to you: I was unable to find one in three different vehicles!) Compounding the problem is that the mount has a very limited positioning range and easily runs out of adjustment room for most potential mounting alternatives.\\n\\n- Cobra does not offer any other mounts or mounting accessories at all - no beanbag or friction mount, no clamp, no fixed-base mount, nothing. If there is any aftermarket option (RAM Mount, etc.) I was unable to find it. You are stuck with Cobra's proprietary mount unless you are willing to modify the unit or its mounting pieces and fabricate an adapter for a Garmin or RAM Mount base.\\n\\nI was *almost* willing to go the extra mile to make this unit work in my vehicle, even though the best solution would have been very awkward to dismount and remount, making it a potential theft target.\\n\\nThe final straw was when I found that the traffic receiver was faulty and I was unable to get a reply from the manufacturer in a timely manner (two days now and counting...) Enough's enough; something was telling me that this unit wasn't the right choice.\\n\\nSo this unit is being returned and I've already ordered a Garmin 2720 with GTM11 traffic receiver in replacement. The prices for the units through Amazon are nearly the same (especially when factoring in the costs for 15 months of traffic monitoring - the Cobra comes with three months and gets $60 per year after that, while the Garmin comes with 15 months and has the same annual cost after that - so you have to add $60 to the Cobra to get a truly equivalent price). Garmin also has excellent mounts with a range of attachment options, some of the best map and routing tools, and a long track record with GPS units. It does have a smaller screen and some complaints about the user interface, but at least I can mount it properly and be able to tuck it away and remount it easily to prevent theft.\\n\\nThis unit gets two stars only because my brief experience with its function appears to live up to all the positive reviews - but overall, it's like a high-performance sports car with no wheels! I 100% recommend against it for California users and suggest that others try to lay hands on a sample unit to see if it can be properly mounted in your vehicle before laying out $750\\n</review_text>,\n",

I called Escort Radar and was told \"If you let the car power up the unit when you start the car, the voltage can be all over the place and the unit gets confused. You must first start the car, and then use the thumbwheel to turn on the detector.\" It makes some sense, but if this is really the case, why don't they put those instructions in their manual?

Easily enough, as it turns out.  \\n\\nI was unable to load it and control the play lists.  Trying to use it in MTP mode always crashed the host (BSOD) so I reverted to MSD (Mass Storage Device) mode using drag and drop.\\n\\nDragging a folder to the device was pointless.  Most of the time the files didn't even show up, and when they did they were scattered all over the place.  I copied 82 files from the Lord of the Rings set into a single folder, only 52 could be found even during play back, but they could be seen from \"My Computer\" on the host system.  After fooling around with it for a couple of hours I gave up and called SanDisk technical support certain they would be able to help me sort it out. \\n\\nI have to admit that I was pleased with their support even though in the end they were unable to resolve any of the problems other than by suggesting that the only way to use drag and drop was to dump everything into the MUSIC folder where it would play in whatever order the device wanted; a totally useless method. \\n\\nThis was totally unsatisfactory since there was no control over the play list and no way to even find all of the files that would fit into 8+gb.  Imagine listening to the first movement of Swan Lake followed immediately by something from 9 Inch Nails, then maybe a Bach Cantata!. \\n\\nUsing Media Player to sync did no better.  Creating a playlist (m3u) of 82 files and then syncing did exactly the same as drag and drop.  A hopeless mess, no play order, missing files and so on.  \\n\\nAfter spending 3 hours with SanDisk tech support we were both more than ready to quit.  The tech had no more idea that I did about how to solve the problems that plagued the player and we both gave it up as a bad job.\\n\\nThis is little machine has plenty going for it in the specification, but it's hopelessly flawed in the implementation, and this is without complaining about the stiff control wheel or the overly small buttons.  \\n\\nThroughly frustrated, it was in the mail being returned less than 8 hours after I received it.  I just cannot recommend this player, it needs a through overhaul of the interface and firmware; and fixing the control wheel and buttons would be a plus as well.

       " <review_text>\\nI had high expectations for this product, having bought some of Sandisk's other products. The problem with the e280 is that Sandisk doesn't give users the control or the versatility over file management. For example, using it in the (mass storage) MSC USB mode, one is forced to create playlists in Windows Media Player. This works, but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped. \\n\\nIt would be far better if one could just drag folders and music mp3 files to the right folder and play them, with multiple folder levels. This would allow catogorizing music the way the user wishes; instead, Sandisk adopts an almost Microsoft mentality in its approach. \"It's our way or the highway.\" Once one masters creating playlists, they have to settle for dumping them all into one directory.\\n\\nIt's too bad because reading the manual and reading the reviews, one can easily get the idea that the e200 series can be set up like just another USB storage device (including other, previous Sandisk products).

The MP3 player itself looks and feels great, and the navigational features are very easy to use.  The problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable.  I have used 3 versions of this player (expecting each time that the player was simply faulty), and all of them glitch up terribly.  I constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play.  It also freezes half of the time that I try to sync with WMP.  In addition, sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my H10's list of tracks (even though they no longer exist on the player).\\n\\nFinally, iRiver has terrible customer service and they do not even back their own products!  As a owner of two iRivers (H10 and the 120), I have seen for a while how they function: they will offer updates for their faulty firmware for about a month, and then they leave that product to produce a new one.  It seems like they have a new Mp3 player being introduced every few months.  Their customer service is extremely hard to get a hold of, and if you do, they will simply say you need to send it to the factory (occasionally you will get a rep that will actually send you a brand new one for free, though).\\n\\nBe smart, stick to a Creative, the new Toshiba Gigabeat S, or (clench your fists) an iPod\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nI purchased 3 of these APs with the expectation to replace 3 Cisco \"b\" APs and drop in. The setup used Radius for authentication which is claimed to be supported in both the online info and docs. After config (the web UI constantly has problems with cookies and forced you to re-login) the system would work. One quark was the IP address field for the radius server wouldn't accept more than one character in the forms. Up and running. However, upon reboot, the WG302 loses it Radius info and then cannot authenticate a client again. SHOWSTOPPER. After logging this with Netgear support - their response is this is an unsupported config and requires premium support. While this would be fine if it was a config issue, it's not ok given they claim support for these features and this was a required feature for purchase. They give no further support now.\\n\\nI would HIGHLY recommend against the extra cost of this unit given it's buggy and has poor support. Config is difficult (I had to learn how to use the command line config), the upgrades are not well documented (they imply you have to import some obscure file with tftp - you don't but...), however the unit does have good range and works (No RADIUS of course) in a basic config.\\n</review_text>,\n",
       " <review_text>\\nFirst - a disclaimer: I know very little about telephone headsets, but decided to buy one because I had a series of long telephone meetings coming up.\\n\\nI walked to my local Staples store, expecting to find a variety of prices and products - and thinking that I'd pay perhaps $30 to $50 at the low end of the market.\\n\\nAt the store, I found that only the computer-based headsets were that cheap - and the only model that worked on a real, old-fashioned land line was the Plantronics S11 on display (it was priced at $130 Canadian).\\n\\nSince work was paying for it, I didn't mind spending the extra money, but expected that, at that price, the quality and ease of use would be quite high.\\n\\nWhen I brough it back to the office and installed it, I found that:\\n\\n- The regular handset and the headset cannot be plugged in at the same time. That means that every time I want to use the headset, I need to fumble around at the back of the unit to switch wires.\\n\\n- The volume of both ingoing and outgoing conversation is very low - even when I turn up the volume controls to max. The people I spoke with complained enough that I switched back to my regular handset.\\n\\n- The microphone, although it's somewhat adjustable, is short and inflexible enough that I can't get it very close enough to my mouth. When I try to move it closer, the earpiece turns and slips off my ear.\\n\\n- The headset itself - that is, the plastic, adjustable arch and rubber pad opposite the speaker - is very awkward and prone to slipping off my head. It might have been better to design it like a regular two-sided earphone unit - so that it would be more balanced and stay secure.\\n\\nI don't know whether these comments apply only to the S11 or to most headsets for traditional phones in general.\\n\\nOverall, however, if I'd been buying the S11 with my own money, I would likely have returned it and just gone back to using the regular phone handset\\n</review_text>,\n",

       " <review_text>\\nMy very first cell phone was Motorola, and it served me great, so I became attached to the brand based on that experience ,and for that reason alone bought  Motorola SD4591 Digital Corded/Cordless System.  As we've put the wireless network in house the cordless phone started playing tricks. The battery life got very short very soon too. I was told I need to get different batteries NiH instead of NiCD. Naturally the microwave was playing the tricks on cordless too. As we have two lines in house and was told by several people to move to 5.8Hz 2 line phone I decided to get Motorola MD7091 5.8GHz Digital 2-line Phone and remained loyal to Motorola. And boy was I wrong again. What others are saying about caller ID not showing as soon as I have another phone on the same line besides Motorola MD 7091 is true in my case too. I don't get it does Motorola expect us to switch phones to their system now around the house if we want to used one of their phones??? This is really cheap trick\\n\\nNaturally, I could blame all this on poor quality of NiCD batteries, Wireless Network, Microwaves and phone company, and other brands' phones connected to my line. But what is the common thread through the entire ordeal: MOTOROLA. I will give other brands a try now, not yet sure which ones\\n</review_text>,\n",

The hardware is very nice but the software keeps on dropping connections. \\n\\nAS usual, I was very careful: I always read manuals and properly install the software before using any product - I don't want to fail the installation for a very simple reason: the package doesn't come cheap... I am a software developer - I have half a dozen computers at home - and I did everything as instructed. I found the software to be very average in terms of usability (why do they try to do all these fancy effects??), but that's not very important when it works fine. \\n\\nUnfortunately, after just a couple of days, the keyboard stopped working. I finally managed to get it back by removing the batteries and rebooting the computer (both step were required - the on/off switch didn't work - same thing for the connect button which is totally ineffective). Now, the mouse keeps on dropping connections. After a couple of hours of inactivity, the mouse simply stops responding.\\n\\nThis is simply unacceptable. Logitech knows that this product doesn't work and keeps on charging customers for something that is simply not usable because it wasn't tested properly.\\n\\nIt is a very frustrating experience because the hardware is great. Don't buy this product, you could be very disappointed.\\n\\nNote that I have seen another installation done by professional Windows system administrators that had the exact same problems.\\n\\nNow don't get me wrong: the hardware is very nice.

At seemingly random intervals, the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether. If this happens during gameplay, you're in a bad way. The keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug. When it comes off of its sleep state, it will double the first key you press. I have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue. Add in that the SetPoint software for the LCD screen only fully works with two pieces of software (MusicMatch and Windows Messenger), and you have a very disappointing desktop package.

       " <review_text>\\nI had Vonage since April, 2006.  I finally switched back to Qwest after unending problems and hours and hours on the phone (my cell phone, as my Vonage line didn't work) with tech support.  Here is my experience:\\n\\n1) It took about 2 months and about 2 hours on the phone for them to switch my existing phone # over to Vonage.  Don't be too excited about getting the first month free- if your moving an existing number it will take about that long to get it switched over.\\n\\n2) After my number was finally switched over, outgoing calls were constantly being dropped after about 20-30 seconds.  Incoming calls would also be dropped occasionally after about a minute.  This resulted in having to call the person back, saying \"sorry the call was dropped- we switched to this cheaper phone service and have been having problems....\"\\nThis is with the highest speed cable internet service available (8mbps download, 600kbps upload) and a wireless 'g' system which has provided top notch internet service consistently while I had Vonage problems.  I spent no less than 4 - 5 calls and over 5 hours on the phone with tech support trying to fix the problem.  After talking with tech support, sometimes the problem would be fixed temporarily- while I was on the phone with them- but return shortly thereafter.\\n\\n3) As a result of the problems I had, I asked to be credited for the months in which my phone service was not working.  Be warned, they are very hard-nosed about providing any credits for poor or no service.  I spoke to a tech support person about getting a credit for a month of no service, and he told me to wait until the problem had been fixed so they could determine how much credit should be given.  After the problem had been fixed (temporarily), I called back and they told me they could only provide credit for the current month, not previous months of no or poor service.  THEY ARE NOT CUSTOMER FRIENDLY ABOUT PROVIDING REFUNDS FOR POOR OR NO SERVICE.\\n\\n4) Finally, in September, still with dropped calls from Vonage, I switched back to Qwest to get reliable phone service.  I found customer service there has improved and is much better than Vonage.  And they gave me 3 months free promotion for coming back.  \\n\\nIn the end, I am happy to pay the extra $10/month (after the first 3 months free) to get phone service that works.  I notice that $5 of the extra cost is for fees, etc. that the phone company has to charge but Vonage does not, which is unfortunate.  In any case, I guess you get what you pay for.\\n\\nOne last thing: Vonage has never made a profit and many business analysts say with their current business plan, they never will.  This means eventually they will either go out of business, or have to raise rates.\\n\\nSave yourself the problems I had- pay the extra $ to get phone service that works\\n</review_text>,\n",

I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out.  I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others.  In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them.  I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time.  The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great.  The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen.

Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that.  I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon.  I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away.  But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery.  I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer.  Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place.\n",

      "So, I was a little weary to buy an iTrip after hearing some mixed reviews. It seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs... or the iTrip worked perfectly. Knowing my luck, it wouldn't work for me at all. I recieved my iTrip and my luck started right away. I tossed the iTrip onto my iPod and..................... nothing. A bad omen? Well, after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing, MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn't find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn't matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned, charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It's not a night-and-day difference, but it's a noticeable improvement. Sure, I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal, but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving, the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weaker-signaled LX mode, not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better, stronger signal. \n",
      "This product is dependant on several outside factors. The reception your car gets and the availability of a clear FM channel. To rate this product poorly because of factors out of it's control is unfair. There were times when I had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. I love good, crisp sound as much as anyone does... but I'll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. \n",
      "\n",
      "My recommendation after owning this product for a short time *but it has been used quite a bit already, as I do a lot of driving*, I say: If you can, buy a tape deck adaptor... but if it's not an option and you don't want to put the money into an \"ipod to car\" setup, this is a viable solution indeed. In my opinion, an iTrip is a better option than listening to plain, old radio.\n",

It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I'm drawing my finger frequently hits it, because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price.

One thing I`ve learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little.  Don`t go recording 3 or 4 -R or +R DVDs every day.  Give it a rest between recordings.  One or two per day is okay.  Definitely give it room to breathe.  If you stack your machines on top of each other, put something in between so they can breathe.  Be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides.

      "I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) \n",
      "\n",
      "The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.\n"

      "With boys aged 2 & 3, and some poor disc storage procedures when I'm driving, it appeared I was in need of one of these units.  Generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs, but it occassionally happens, and doesn't take long for scratches, damage and finger prints to hinder performance, and when changing children's cds in the car I don't always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also.  I read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products, and finally decided on this unit because it runs on a/c power, is fully contained and automatic, and was about $10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit.  Both items had mixed reviews - mostly positive, but I found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all, and one that skipped.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This product repairs a disc to \"useable\" condition, it does not repair it so that scratches are not visible.  I can still see, but not necessarily feel the scratches.  It's also important to remember that some scratches do not affect performance.  If a disc plays well, but shows scratches - I just clean off the finger prints with a cloth or use the unit to clean the disc and see if the performance is satisfactory before attempting a full repair.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I agree that the instructions with the unit could be better. I saved the instructions provided by another reviewer to use with the provided instructions for clarity. Also, some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair, so I agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items - but it is possible.  I noticed that I could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the buffing/sanding (pink disc) process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair.  I ran one disc through 3 times in a row, then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine.  My lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great.  I usually clean the disc (manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime), then buff, then repair.  It can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning, but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable.  I think this was good purchase and not overly complicated to use. \n",

Luckily (?) those other radios also died pretty quickly. This Sangean product solves the AM reception problem and seems very durable. I also own their CCRadio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation.  I love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the built-in speaker, just like transistor radios of the 50's and 60's--a seemingly forgotten feature.  As for listening through the supplied earphones, forget it. Sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied.  Never have I heard tinnier sound, even for AM listening.  Not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short.  I immediatey invested another $35 in decent pair of Koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin.  Now I happily and easily listen to AM and FM stations even over the roar of the lawnmower.

      "\n",
      "The sound is very flat. The lack of depth makes it feel as if the sound is coming from a flat wall or a small box rather than from a space, especially if you stand further away (over 5 ft.) from the speakers. It seems that the speakers have a much lower than published sensitivity level. However, don't get discouraged because with most speakers/headphones it may be that the speakers need some time to burn in (loosen the diaphragm) to get a bit more \"sustain\" to their output rather than seem to have a very sharp cutoff.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bass is very punchy, and not deep. I would definitely recommend a subwoofer for these speakers, as their highs are very good, and midranges are nice but maybe a bit flat. The subwoofer will party compensate for the problem, and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect (use the LFE on your receiver for the sub-woofer... don't worry, low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo won't suffer). In other words, you will need a lot of tweaking and additions to make these sound nicer than their out-of-the box quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ignore the 50kHz rating for ultra-high-frequency sound as a positive feature, as no receiver you will buy at the budget for these speakers will be rated for that output. Most are rated for 20 Hz - 20kHz, at a reasonable RMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "You get what you pay for... for the price tag on them, the SSMF650H are good. They perform reasonably well on highs and mids (but in no means studio reference sound), and are crisp and punchy on the bass. They do however seem to lack depth and have low sensitivity - especially so on the bass... the further you move away from them (and especially if you stand up above them), the sound quality suffers.\n",

If you're looking for deep and bass-heavy sound without a sub-woofer, and are willing to take a hit on mids and highs a bit this is your \"budget solution\" instead of the SS-MF650H. I was pleasantly surprised. They also have poor sensitivity though, so if you have a big room shop around for something better.\n",

When I got home, I plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better. I am very impressed of the volume and sound quality I can get from them on my computer. My soundcard is an onboard Soundmax AC97 on an Asus K8V-X motherboard. I set the sound option in Windows XP on \"headphones\" and played \"Metallica- Nothing else matters\" with WinAmp. WOW !!! I was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general. I only use half of the volume available in Windows XP and it`s more than enough for me.\n",

Recharge before your event each day and you won't miss a thing. The unit only uses one battery and it's always a great idea to have a spare. The unit does not audibly warn when the battery is about to expire, so keeping a fresh charge should provide you with uninterrupted recordings. Each stop and restart begins a new file. For me that works great! If you are looking for one continuous file, do not shut it off. You can also buy software that will let you merge the files for your later use.

Offering two lines of crisp, highly readable print gives a professional appearance to all labeling needs. My experience is quite different than some reviewers who have complained about wasted tape. In fact, I found that little wasted tape is generated if you simply adjust the margins to a particular task and this option is clearly spelled out in the instruction booklet. Since I purchased the 1750, I have found many uses for it around the home office and I wonder how I got by without one in the past! My only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters, it does not offer a dash or hyphen, so when one is  required, I find myself using a star instead. That is a minor complaint though.

      "I've had 2 other FM transmitters (A Belkin and a Griffin iTrip). Neither came close to the quality of this transmitter. Neither charged the iPod (The Belkin required batteries, which only lasted about 15 hours of use), while the iTrip worked OK at first, but then started getting static no matter what station I used. In fact, I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away (and then, it was still not clear). The sound isn't as loud as some (it takes over the volume control, so you cant use the volume on the iPod.) Still, it's not nearly as soft as some I've seen. I found most music came through at a good volume (I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up). This unit, although it seems cheap and flimsy at first, is able to get a consistant, strong signal, even on stations which usually come in clearly. It powers through them, and the result is a very clean sound. It is a little hard to read at the regular angle, but once you set the 3 presets, you don't need to see the screen. Just set your radio to the same 1-2-3 configuration. Also, turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer. In all, I couldn't be happier\n",

      "The other definite high point for this PDA is the screen.  Once you see a VGA screen like this, you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a QVGA screen.  I have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels.  The screen is crystal clear.  \n",
      "The battery life is phenomenal, even with the standard low capacity battery.  Playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours, extended to about 4.5 hours on low brightness and headphones.  Turned off with a 1GB SD card drains the battery about 2% per day.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Weaknesses: Not enough programs to start with, Windows Media Player 10 (Download TCPMP, it's way better)\n",
      "\n",
      "Problems: Don't use Odyssey Client, it makes the PDA start up really slow.  Also, in ActiveSync, On the PDA, select Menu, Add Server Source.  On all of the screens, put random characters in each field, and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize.  Then go to menu, schedule and select manual for both.  Then go to menu, options, and delete the entry that you just added (the one that has no boxes under it checked) and delete it.  It fixes a myriad of problems and makes the PDA run faster, and it still syncs automatically in the cradle.\n",

      "I recently received the Zen Microphoto as a gift.  Since I travel fairly often, I decided to purchase the Traveldock after reading the reviews.  It's great.  The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply.  The sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that I own.  Many people comment on the bass issue.  For travel speakers, the Traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion.  True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative's website).  I'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience.  The jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit.  Also, the Microphoto charges while docked, whether it's playing or not.  There's even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also).  By the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3's, adjust volume, and play/pause/FF/Rew.  Overall, this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto.\n",

The stereo effect button works great, the design is very stylish and the remote is a nice finishing touch. now for the cons;like most reviewers,i too, have to say the bass is lacking a bit, and the stand has a bit of trouble holding the speakers up due to small rubber feet that doesnt grip very well. and the last thing is the speakers itself doesnt have any grill or guard on it and it looks like it could be damaged easily, but these are minor things i can overlook and all in all for the price, this speaker system is very good.    \n",

      "Echoing most other reviews here, this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money.  But buying them is a risk! If you don't wear these earphones correctly, they sound terrible, easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones.

      "Learning how to put them in properly takes time.  Be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions.  Once you teach yourself how to put them in, it will only take a few seconds.  Some tips: Before inserting the earbuds, draw the phones up from behind your ear, holding the earbuds in the correct orientation (drivers pointing medially), so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals. With one hand, pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other.  This straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone.  (Your doctor uses the same maneuver when he/she examines you with an otoscope.) You may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better.  If the phones are properly inserted, they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your Eustachian tubes (that is, swallow), just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator.\n",

      "1. Very good bass & well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71, the ER4p has tight but the least bass-feel/effect.)  Mid-range is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.)\n",

This also makes it easy to each lunch while listening to music so your food doesn't spill on the wire.\n",

The screen is really bright with the full color display. The new earbuds are A LOT more comfortable than the old ones. The new ones aren't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out. I don't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me! The new color coating is scratch resistant, but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol. But you don't notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos. I'm so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out. I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily, have a dark screen, and have a short battery life.

THX Certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry, offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "A digital signal is a digital signal.  This is fiber optic cable -it uses light to transmit the digital data -it doesn't degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable.  So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables, they just are going be a little less durable, and probably use slightly less high quality materials.  Are they fragile? Not at all, but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily.  If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable.  (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly -i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).\n",

      "(P.S. for first time users, don't forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables.

For those users who travel frequently (or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often), you may want to exercise extra caution. The blue LED light that some reviewer claims is too \"strong\" is a minor quibble--if you really wanted to, you could always tape over the light and problem solved. As for the fan noise, I would say the low setting is comparable to \"white noise,\" which you don't really notice until you purposely try to listen for it! The high setting, on the other hand, is a bit loud, and I can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or TV to compensate.

      "The sound is loud and crisp but definetely mid-trebley, as with most in-ear headphones. The low end is there, but for full effect, it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume. Since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves, this sweet spot is not very wide. That said, however, I recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small. Most bass-rich systems utilize either massive speakers/ woofers or chambered enclosures (or both) to deliver. Since the size of this type of headphones doesn't permit for either big speakers or special chambers, maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber! I am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for. Such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package. Maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard (for the price they better be).  So if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback, look into buying those pricey phones.  The lack of such bass is the only reason \n",
      "i didn't give it five stars.\n",

      "I don't normally write reviews on products but in this case I feel I must share the value and features of this product.  You can't go wrong in selecting this player/recorder for your DVD needs.  The quick start guide is just that \"quick\" and well planned.  The people at Samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best I have seen well documented with pictures (in full color) and just that step-by-step for the novice.  The setup diagram is excellent.  The features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize (any disc) and away you go.  One touch record starts immediately.  The quality is superb especially in High Definition. I couldn't wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last Electronics Trade Show so I was able to get it from back East about three weeks ago. Finalizing discs is a snap and easy I have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the Samsung is so easy the on-screen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers! It will play mp3s, CDs, computer made DivX movies, Region 1 DVDs, Picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly.  You can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer's codes which they list in a handy guide.

I've been using one of these or its predecessors since the early 90's when Kensington first came out with the \"Turbo Mouse\".  It was great then, and now it's better.  This is as solid, smooth, and precise of an input device as you can get.  I don't understand those others with buttons on the side that when you press them the trackball slides across your desk.  This baby stays right where you put it because your button presses go straight down.  You can use it with just the tips of your fingers or your whole hand -- your choice.  The optical version is far superior to the old mechanical ones that needed frequent cleaning to stay in tip top performance.  The only drawback is the $100 retail price, but frankly it's worth that.  It's a no brainer at $80 which is what I paid through Amazon to Tiger Direct.

      "My experience: I've had two pairs of these for over a year and I like them very much. I enjoy great sound watching TV or listening to music while everybody is asleep. This is really great, I can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night. The sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the TV. You have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the TV (closet or the garage for example). The headphones are light and very comfortable. I tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far. So, overall wonderful product. However, there a few flaws to be aware of. Consider the following before buying. It might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel. Sometimes, turning the headphones ON results in poor reception if any at all. To correct this, you have to press the only button (power, search, and turn off) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel. You might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying. Once you get good reception, everything is ok although you might get some interference (alien noises) when you turn your head or move around. The last problem is with the turn off button (again the only multifunction button). You need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit. That is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on. You think you turned it off but it is still on and if it's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely. Well, I hope my description is helpful. \n",

      "I have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set (a Midiland 5.1 system) was thoroughly aged and falling apart I decided it was time to upgrade.  I wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd's.  I shopped around and came to the conclusion I would aim for the form factor speakers.  When considering this bose system, this MUST be taken into account.    \n",
      "\n",
      "First off, this system is expensive.  For just under 1000 dollars (doesn't 999 sound sooo much better than 1g?) you get 5 bi-directional midrange speakers, the subwoofer unit, and speaker cable.  At this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver, but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget.  Bose includes 3 colors (white, silver, black) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit (a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not). \n",
      " \n",
      "What brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness.  For their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any sound-granted they are paired with a competent receiver.  Anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through, without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Once I got the system home it was very easy to set up and install.  Bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong to-a very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system.  The only serious issue I have with this system ended up being with my receiver (an Onkyo) and not related at all with the speakers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Since I do run this through my computer (presently a laptop) I had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver, but when that was all said and done, I was extremely please with the system.  With a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tag-its target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My test soundtracks included:  Gladiator, Matrix (II or III), Snatch, and music tracks ranging from techno, rock, classical, and alternative.  Everything sounded great with enough low, high, and midrange response.  The second complaint I have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites.  I found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers weren't drowning out the voices.  That was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs (though draining my bank account) and providing me with great surround sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good:  Great range and volume of sound.  Easy set-up.  Well built speakers-aesthetically and physically.  No interference or feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad:  Subwoofer awkward, no dedicated center channel, pricey, no included receiver.\n",

      "Just a quick note to say that it is a pity that people buy 'toys' before exploring what it is that they're buying.  I have seen people knock the SanDisk U3 drives, as well as U3 drive made by other companies.  Well the reality is that:\n",
      "\n",
      "a- The U3 software has a way of stopping the software's auto-boot.\n",
      "\n",
      "b- There is Uninstall software available at at SanDisk.com and at U3.com, and I'm guessing that those company's that offer U3 and have a web site probably have the 'Uninstaller' on their site.\n",
      "\n",
      "c- There is a great deal of U3 software available (free and pay-for-it) at U3.com.  I know that SanDisk has a software site, so do Verbatim & Memorex.\n",
      "\n",
      "d- For those who want portable software but don't want U3 or don't have a U3 drive, go to http://portableapps.com.  Note: some of the software here is the same used by the U3 folks, without using the U3 LaunchPad.\n",
      "\n",
      "e- Quality of drives: remember that when you buy most of the electronics 'toys' available today, you are buying Chinese c*** (junk).  Both the manufacturing and Quality Control (QC) are garbage.  Unless you are paying serious change for something ($500+) you will get passable junk.  If you are expecting \"made in Japan quality\" your kidding yourself.  This is the reason you will see many Brand Name goods, also selling with No-Name labels (i.e Coby).  Same production line, different labels.  It is also one of the reason folks are impressed with Apple iPods.  Apple demands excellent QC, and the destruction of goods that don't meet the standard.  In exchange you are willing to pay a 20% premium for this level of QC.  Like everything in life, ya gets whats ya pay for.\n",
      "\n",
      "g- Since the beginning of Windows (v1.0, et al) there have always been buggy and uncooperative software programs, there will always be pain in the a** software.  One of the reasons XP has such a prominent 'roll-back' feature.  And also the reason many, if not MOST, power users run multiple machines.  Of course, these days we have to fill Billy G's pockets by having to buy multiple paks of XP.  Most of my power-user friends run at least three or four machines, each one with a different use.  It shouldn't be this way, but the reality is that for folk that use or explore a great deal of software, for many purposes (MP3's, scanning, Video, controlling radios, composing music, et al), one machine won't cut it because XP ain't as stable as folks think.  The more programs, and the more varied in type, the more instability is introduced into ANY Windows installation. Why do you think businesses run Win2000 or Win2003, because there are less software 'toys' that run under 2K, and the 'admin' can prevent you from loading a lot of software 'toys'.\n",
      "\n",
      "h- In the end, understand what you are buying before you buy so that you'll have better luck getting what you want, and you won't look so ignorant when you say something that anyone who has bothered to go to the web site(s) knows is dead wrong, or just plain stupid.\n",

I got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of E20s and the E30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend. \n",

      "The E20s and E30s are listed as \"Bookshelf Speakers.\" The E20s ARE bookshelf speakers. As I wrote in my review of the E20s, the E30s can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is Kong and your first name is King! The E20s are heavy at 7lbs each, not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are. The E30s are HEAVY. HEAVY! 16 lbs each. (That is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs!) They are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep. They need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor. \n",

      "I am very pleased with both the E20s and E30s. For small speakers, the E20s have some oomph and can be cranked up. The E30s have OOOMMPHHHH. They WANT to be cranked up. Yesterday I tried them out by listening to my mp3 files of the Animals Singles and Paul Revere and the Raiders Kicks. When cranked up, the E30s sound at least 1000% better than the the E20s.  I hooked them up to my vintage JVC AV receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power. At a little over half volume my ears began to hurt. You can really feel the bass and the drums kick. \n",

      "I also listened to about 2 hours of The Doors via Rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver. I have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the 60s. The E30s are simply incredible! They brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest surprise with the E30s is that they sound very good at lower volumes, not as good as the E20s, but still very good. As I write, I am watching/listening to a DVD of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons concertos performed by Herbert Von Karajan, the BPO and Anne-Sophie Mutter on fiddle and am running the E30s and E20s at about 15% volume--pretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver. Yet I can still HEAR everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord. Since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels, I am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums. \n",
      "\n",
      "I bought the E30s for under $90 including s/h. Back in the early 80s or late 70s I spent more than four times this amount (adjusted for inflation) for 2 large, heavy Advent Loudspeakers with 8\" woofers. The E30s clearly sound better than I ever remember the Advents sounding including better bass response, and I liked the Advents! Over time, our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper. You still can spend mega bucks and buy a $10,000 McIntosh system (or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as I saw at one website!) It all depends on what your budget is.

      "First off, let me say that this is a VERY impressive monitor.  My points of reference for that statement are my other three LCD monitors: three Samsung models, two of which are 913Ns and the other is a 712N.  These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic, and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic.  Surprisingly, I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic, but, for my taste and needs, the Samsungs are simply too bright, and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.  For high light, daytime use, I have found that I do like to have the brightness all the way up on the ViewSonic, but I truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installation was simple: in fact, something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that, interestingly again, the drivers that are on the ViewSonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation CD, even though the driver package that is posted on the ViewSonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago.  When I first installed this monitor and turned it on, I truly do not think the picture was as clear, or the graphics as rich, as any of the Samsung monitors that I own.  But, and this is another tip for new users of this product, the default setting for the ViewSonic screen contrast was set MUCH lower than the maximum setting.  When I increased the contrast up to its maximum setting, I believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal, if not fully equal, to those on the other LCDs that I own.\n",
      "\n",
      "One big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a DVI cable included, so you save that added expense (this isn't true with all ViewSonics).  And, especially with the digital connection, I have no doubts about ViewSonic's claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the Samsungs.  I have to admit that I wasn't sure I needed a widescreen display, but I believe it's going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones!  This is a really a fine monitor!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for a few small negatives.  One reason I haven't purchased ViewSonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers.  I already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer, so I really have no use for monitor speakers.  Additionally, those ViewSonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Strains my neck.  The reason I really didn't worry about it on this monitor was because, while there are speakers, they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other ViewSonic monitors.  With that said, I have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than I had expected.  For example, on the 17 inch Samsung monitor, the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4\" from the desktop.  On the 19 inch Samsungs, it is 4 inches.  On this ViewSonic, the bottom of the screen is 5 1/2 inches above the desktop.  It's not bad, but it's going to take a bit of getting used to.  If all else fails, other monitor stands are available.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with most electronic products these days, there is very little in the way of documentation.  The 87 billion language installation card tells diddly.  The .PDF manual that is installed on the computer simply says the standard self-explanatory things.  However, I found the interactive help program on the manufacturer's website be quite useful in helping fix a few small problems, surprisingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I'm very impressed so far, and I'm really looking forward to using this monitor!  By the by, shipping from Amazon.com was amazingly fast: it shipped the next day, and it arrived the day after that.  I can't complain about that speed!

      "For reference, I've owned a set of Labtec APX-6420 2.1 speakers for about 6-7 years now. With the purchase of a a new computer (Mac Pro + Cinema Display) I decided it was also time to upgrade my speakers. I spent a very long time mulling over different brands and models, listening to them in stores whenever possible. Of the major \"PC speaker\" makers, I recall sampling Altec Lansing, Logitech, Klipsch, Bose, Creative, and JBL. Aside from listening in stores (a poor environment) I also took into account personal experience with the brands (mostly the first three I listed) in regular \"home\" situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I initially wanted the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1's because of the fantastic reviews they've gotten on Amazon and elsewhere, but was turned off to them because of the apparently poor build quality (parts breaking very quickly), along with reports of buzzing, the power switch being on the back of the subwoofer, my impression of them in stores, and experience with a friend's ProMedia 4.1's (which neither I nor him really cared for, and which recently broke).\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried as many Logitech speakers as I could in many different situations and  decided I HATE ALL OF THEM (with the sole exception of the Z-5500's which I own and love)! The bass especially sucks on their speakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So... through all this I eventually came to the conclusion that Altec Langsing was the brand I wanted to go with. And if that was so, it had to be the FX6021's which I had been eyeing for years. The first time I heard them in a store I declared them my favorite of the selection at the time and the same is still true. These are probably the best sub-$200 2.1 PC speakers you can buy. Even at their MSRP of $250 they're probably worth it. These speakers a very nice!\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound is very clear and sharp. Get ready to hear all the distortion in your low bitrate digital audio files. The speakers especially shine when listen to live recordings or anything that was produced by real instruments (i.e. not techno, though that sounds good too).\n",
      "\n",
      "Subwoofer is NOT \"boomy\" or \"buzzy\" like others have reported. I never use the equalizer in iTunes and have the bass at about half. It's very deep, rich, and discrete. Doesn't shake the floor or cause my neighbors to complain--yes, I live in an apartment too and bass is a concern of mine. For those who complain about the bass: maybe you shouldn't have gotten 2.1 speakers? Maybe your units were defective? Or perhaps the subwoofer was placed in a very poor position? I know sound is highly subjective, but those reviews just don't sound right to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "PROs:\n",
      "* Tall, sleek, and sexy satellites provide a nice wall of sound and match the Cinema Display perfectly.\n",
      "* Bass and treble have a *large* range of adjustability. 50% of either is plenty enough for me.\n",
      "* Power button on control pod\n",
      "* This is important: NO BUZZING. Not while they're on, not while they off. 100% silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONs:\n",
      "* Volume adjustment is digital and moves in \"notches\"; these notches aren't always small enough. I much prefer a regular analog knob.\n",
      "* Remote is a bit useless\n",
      "* While they look good and perform well, they feel a little cheap\n",
      "* Get ready for lots of cables hanging from your desk and all over the floor (on the other hand, long cables are a PRO as well)\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, don't be fooled by specs. Yes, other speakers may have more watts of power and THX certification, but that really doesn't matter as much as it might seem. These are more than loud enough for any sane person (100% volume would probably wake up the neighborhood).

These SD cards are made in Japan by Toshiba (they are then rebranded and sold by PNY, Lexar, DaneElec, etc.) and I have been very pleased with them so far.  They work flawlessly with no write-speed delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound, and the card reader in my HP Pavilion M7480N Media Center PC (running Windows XP Professional service pack 2) reads the pictures and video into my Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 and Premiere Elements 2.0 software programs with no problems.  The only drawback is that the read-speed on these standard SD cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster SD cards...it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full 1GB card onto my PC...but I find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem.  So, if a little longer read time is not a problem for you, then save yourself some money and buy this card.  Overall, a very good standard SD card at an excellent price!     \n",

      "This is the Ultimate Ears Super fi model especially designed for \"bassheads,\" featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies. I don't think UE would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature. Yes, the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed, but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the bright side, however, the bass reproduction is  marvelous. Not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones I've ever used, the quality is excellent. The bass is tight and pleasant, neither boomy nor thumpy. This overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the UE 5 EB's ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented \"front and center,\" including techno bass (aka \"car audio bass\"), drum n' bass, and many types of rap/hip-hop. For music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall, opinions will vary. With rock music, for example, the strong bass is certainly a plus, but I have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly, and some detail is lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that this bass-dominated sound signature renders the EB's a good choice for people who own iPods and feel that their music player is weak on bass. Without any EQ adjustment, the iPod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is PRESENT. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of build, the EB's superficially seem well-constructed and designed. I have heard complaints, however, that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage. Be careful out there! Thoughtfully, EB has includes a variety of ear tips with these IEM's (including foam, flanged, and plain) so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit. The EB's don't extend deeply into the ear canal, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal, comfort is good and isolation decent. However, if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating. Making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the EB's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and some people think that the EB's look kind of strange when worn. Larger than the higher-priced Super fi 5 Pro model, the EB's stick out a bit. Your call as to whether this is a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like all of the UE IEM's in this series, the EB's are packaged with a nice set of accessories, including a 1/4\" adapter plug, a sound attenuator, a soft travel case, an earwax loop, and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with IEM's, cord tangling.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's unlikely that the EB's will prove satisfactory as your \"everyday\" earphone unless you listen solely to bass-dominant types of music. The truth is, however, that even for bass-heavy music the overall sound signature of the Super fi 5 Pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users (I own both).

In other words, I don't talk with the phone cradled between my shoulder and ear. And I don't use speaker phone features. Let's just get that out of the way now since those are things some have complained about that I couldn't care less about.\n",

      "This phone first of all looks good and FEELS good. It was built with high quality plastics and metals on all surfaces. It has a nice solid weight to itself. Nothing tacky or cheap about it. It looks far better in person than it ever did in pictures. And it looks pretty good in pictures. I like how the bases are designed such that the antennas serve a double purpose as cradle supports for when the phone is docked. Clever design. The charging base light and back-lit buttons all look very slick.\n",

I don't know for sure if this phone falls into that category, but I was in the market for a 5.8 GHz phone to avoid interference with my WiFi networks as well as to avoid microwave oven interference with my calls.  One thing's for sure: this phone definitely is immune from MY microwave oven. In the past when I was on a call heating up my coffee, static and voice quality went way down unless I got far away from the oven. With this new phone I can stand right by it while on High w/o ANY impact on voice quality.\n",

      "One other very cool feature is the spare battery charger. While it's nice that the battery can replace a unit that runs down in a handset right away, the best part is if you have a power failure.

The phone base unit picks up the current time from the caller ID info provided by the phone company and uses that info to automatically set and broadcast the current time to all headsets and base station. No need to manually set the clock. And when not in use, sitting it is dock, the phone's screen displays the time.\n",

I've since bought Canon's 15 sheet packs multiple times.  I now use the Kodak stuff for drafts or to give prints to people who don't care much about the quality of the output, while I save the Canon Photo Paper Pro for prints we want to frame\n",

Occasionally, on long or \"bouncy\" trips, it'll creep out of position a couple inches and I'll have to move it back.

I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin.

I wasn't expecting as good or better quality than I can already get, but I hoped the Samson C01B USB Studio Condenser would at least give me a decent sound.  The idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits.  I was not disappointed.  Installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a USB port on my laptop running XP and the other end into the mic.  It is far from the best mic I have, but it is certainly not the worst.  I have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin, but I found that not to be the case.  The noise floor when recording with the Samson is a little high, and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my Millenia preamp.   I have to record at slightly lower levels than I am used to, but for $79, I am not complaining.  There is no significant latency recording 16 bits at 44100hz in Fasoft N-Track Studio.

This phone uses phone company voice mail (no built-in ans mach) - which is fine - but I had the VM system go bonkers so lost all trust in it.  For over a week messages accumulated but we got no stutter-tone so didn't know there were any new messages - arrgghh.  Not the phones fault I know but it required VM for messaging so nope. \n",

I liked it's simplicity and easy switching between line 1 and 2.  Had battery backup for use during power outages and the best voice quality of the three.  But, it's answering system has no message counter.  That alone is no big deal but it didn't have any indicator to say whether you had any saved messages.  When a new message arrived it blinked and such - all good.  But, if I got home, say, and listened to a message for my wife, the blinking stopped and no indication of \"1 saved message\" or anything.  So, I would have to write a note to her to check the messages.  We're so used to relying on seeing a message counter and just listening to them if it's not zero that we thought this would become a nuisance.  I also would have liked an auto-line-selection so it would automatically answer the ringing line or select a non-busy outgoing line.  But, that would have messed up their simpler style button function - hmmm.\n",

With the right settings and phone company options (busy-forward), it elegantly supports two lines as if they are one.  I really like not thinking about which line is what - just pick up and talk.\n",

Don't underestimate this, if you use the net at a library or cafe then you'll realize that 1. not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2. you've got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port, which gets annoying quickly. when you clean out your purse and discover you don't have it with you. With this you get both in one. It has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems, even win98.

      "\n",
      "Some notes on the contract:\n",
      "1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\n",
      "2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n",
      "3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n",
      "4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n",
      "5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n",
      "6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n",

      "Assuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy).

      "The V200 is another great Logitech product. It is far from the king of the mouse, but when it comes to the notebook it doesn't get much better than this. It takes two AA batteries (so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots. The mouse doesn't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves. This is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel. With the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do. Overall the design is good. There could be a problem installing setpoint. It may hang on install. If so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again. It should work. The USB receiver is 2.4 GHz and has a 10 Meter range. Wow. However there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook. USB dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off. For this reason you should have the USB receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand, if you can, to avoid accidental contact. It should also not be hanging over the edge of the table. If you press it down lightly, then that is it, game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 GHz receiver. So okay you will have to spend on a new receiver, if you break the old one. The receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet. When it is in the holder the mouse turns off. It doesn't fit in smoothly. It creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse. Anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in. The other thing is that it can pop out sometimes. Just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way. I am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices. If you are then a mouse like this and USB should last for a very long time. There is really nothing wrong with it. Wireless mini mouse. FAB! However there is one last thing to say. If you don't like the idea of a USB receiver then GET A BLUETOOTH VERSION OF THIS MOUSE INSTEAD. It is called the V270. That is if your notebook has internal Bluetooth or else you will need to get a Bluetooth USB receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your USB receivers. But if you have a Bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the V270 and forget about this USB option. The USB design isn't a fault with the mouse; it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault.

I had bought a 1G Nano lanyard at a local store and had to return it when I discovered it was incompatible (the dock connector and headphone jack on the 1G and 2G Nanos are NOT the same distance apart).  When this 2G lanyard arrived, I could find nothing on the package that said \"for 2G Nano\", so I opened it very gingerly thinking I had received the wrong lanyard and would need to repackage it and send it back.  I was very relieved when it did fit!  Regardless, there should be a very clear \"For 2G Nanos only!\" label on the box to alleviate 2G Nano owners' fears and to warn 1G Nano owners.\n",

      "Having been a buyer of Sennheiser products for over 10 years, I feel it is time I endorse a product I truly believe in, and have never been let down by. Including service and customer satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each time buying a Sennheiser product, I found myself stepping up to the next level of their headphones, because they simply keep improving their technology to the point that what you used to own by them gets overwhelmed by the latest headphone they offer. When I bought the HD-600's, I had just come away from years owning the HD-25. When these encountered a technical problem, I replaced them with a backup choice, the HD-25SP's. The difference in sound going 'lower' down their scale of products was just too much to bear. So I bit the bullet and went higher. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whether you use Sennheiser's merely for pleasure, or for studio work, the accuracy of their sound, and what you get for your money cannot be beat. My HD-600's ran into a small technical glitch (and Sennheiser were extremely helpful in getting this fixed and replaced within 2 days of receipt), and I swear I nearly cried in their absence. HD-600's give you a clear idea of how things were recorded, how good your system is, and what truly sounds inferior. You never listen to things quite the same way again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason my reviews of Paul McCartney and John Lennon albums from the 70's all comment on how inferior the recording quality is (especially compared to the so called ''Economy Class Beatles'' George Harrison's and Ringo Starr's albums from the same decade), is down to what HD-600's reveal. My main source of media tends to be Vinyl, because Compact Discs and DVD's still cannot capture what analogue/turntable equipment captures. Vinyl is simply warmer and more 'round' in comparison to its digital counterparts. And when listening to badly recorded albums, HD-600's make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio. HD-600's are the reason I mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying Lennon and McCartney solo albums. Listening to ''Take IT Away'' from 1982's Tug Of War reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield. Which sounds much like someone forgot to 'silence' a track that had a recording on it, before the instrument actually showed up in the song. It sounds totally like electrical / amp noise coming from equipment, and Geoff Emerick or George Martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song. \n",
      "\n",
      "It gets much worse than 'Take It Away' on Paul McCartney albums, and even more painfully so on John Lennon albums. But listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums BACK TO THE EGG, RAM, DOUBLE FANTASY, MILK AND HONEY, and some portions of BAND ON THE RUN, and WALLS AND BRIDGES. #9 Dream is simply a gorgeous recording, it's just too bad the rest of the album doesn't sound as good as that one song.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you listen to your CD's, vinyl, DVD's in whatever room of your house your speakers are, the room dictates what you hear, no matter what you've spent on speakers, power amps, woofers, sub-dividers, etc. Whether you have wall to wall carpeting, high ceilings, low ceilings, plaster or cement, wood floors, a more long than wide room, it all affects how sound reaches your ear. Which is why on a great set of headphones, you are more likely to hear HOW those sounds were meant to be heard, how they were recorded, and how much time was spent doing it. On speakers, McCartney's JET sounds quite full, though the snare is a little thin. But when hearing the album with HD-600's, the drums nearly become non-existent, and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent, you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone. McCartney on drums is not a miracle, especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on Bass. \n",

Only problem was, I didn't like being shackled to my computer in order to hear them.   I did some research on the internet, read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the Logitech Wireless Music System.  I would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was indeed quite fast and easy to set up.  No lengthy manuals to read (thank goodness.)  I did not find it necessary to load the CD software that came with the device.

      "I am 100% satisfied with the sound quality.  I would not be able to tell the difference between FM radio and the online streaming.  However, I do have to turn up my stereo about twice as loud when I am sending internet audio streams to it using this device, than when I am listening to a CD or the radio.  On my stereo (which isn't fancy), this does not cause diminished sound quality, so I'm perfectly OK with it.  I just have to remember to turn down the volume before switching back to CD or radio listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are wondering whether the device will be compatible with your stereo, check for two things.  First, your stereo has to have a set of two holes side-by-side that are for the twin plugs generally colored white and red.  I'm sorry I do not know the technical names for these things, but there's a picture of the red-and-white plugs on this Amazon page in the Manufacturer's \"Product Description\" section (just scroll up until you see it.)  Second, your stereo has to have a button that will let you switch to \"Auxiliary\" input.  My stereo has this, but my portable CD player/cassette player/radio (AKA boom box) does not.   If it is important to you to be able to use this on a portable player you can carry around the house and/or outside, be sure to check your player for these two things.\n",

I enjoy the fact you can still easily access the buttons and menus through it. Both the leather case and the larger case have an atachee on the back, if you wished to connect them to the cord that comes with it. The cleaning cloth works as well as any lense cloth, great for cleaning. The screen protector is a pain in the rear to apply without bubbles, still haven't figured out how yet, and I may trim it to make it more visually appealing. But, really, if you invest in a product such as this, it really makes sense to protect the easily scratched screen! The larger case is compact and protective, having a small storage area, yet the cover is a bit unsightly because of the cheap, generic looking Sansa logo. Only other complaint is that the leather case goes on a belt, but not as a removable type. Only if you put it on when putting on the belt, which can be impractical in some circumstances.

One thing that I  did find out - keep the transfers dry after they have been printed. One got  wet in the rain and it spotted very badly wherever a rain drop came in  contact.

      "We purchased the YSP-1 in August as a companion to our Hitachi Ultravision wall-mounted television.  What a fabulous piece of audio equipment!\n",
      "\n",
      "When we began searching for a replacement for our Infiniti surround system, my husband and I had different concerns.  He is an audiophile that demands wide range digital sound with full depth of field and I was ready for aestethic simplicity (no speakers throughout the room and wires everywhere).  When we found the YSP-1 we thought it was too good to be true.  One speaker instead of five?  Wall-mounted?  Doesn't take up any floor space?  We visited two Yamaha dealers to see it for ourselves.  One had the YSP-1 set up in a room environment.  The other, on the salesroom floor.  In both set-ups it performed consistantly.  In both demonstrations however, my husband felt the low-end sound could use enhancement.  So, we made the purchase and opted to use the YSP-1 with our existing subwoofer.  Installation was fairly simple, provided you have the necessary tools.  The most important, and time-consuming part was leveling and centering the speaker under the television.  Now that it is installed and in use in our home, I feel the low-end sound is quite adequate and prefer not to use the sub-woofer.  My husband though, prefers the earth-shaking action sequences in movies to mimic their intended theatre quality sound.  More than movies the sound quality you get when listening to CDs is absolutely stunning.  Overall, we both got what we wanted.  Expert sound designation and sleek, minimalistic styling (with the added bonus of more floor and wall space). \n",

The yellow foam plugs are easy to use and work just like the ear foams many people use in industrial applications.  They effectively seal the ear canal and are very comfortable.  Although they seem a bit expensive I've found that once they get dirty you can use water and a bit of dish detergent to clean them.

Until a few hours ago, I was running two 20\" aluminum cinema displays on a PNY 6600GT.  After doing online research about using the 30\" display under Windows XP, I found that the \"functional\" cheap solution being used is in fact the PNY 6600GT (Verto 128MB DDR3 with two DVI connectors).  Considering that the other two most noted solutions, QuadroFX 4000 AGP or Parhelia DL256 PCI, are going for $600+ on ebay, I was willing to give my old beater a try.

The 30\" is enormous enough that I think it might be better were it curved!  Maybe I'm just sitting too close.\n",

I'm not a gamer, so I can't say whether the card performs well for that.  It feels as zippy as with the 20\" on regular windowing tasks.  I use Eclipse, Flash, Photoshop, etc., but no video editing or 3D stuff.\n",

      "\n",
      "If you don't tell the unit where to look, though, it can take quite a while to search for a Point of Interest.  I didn't know which city to specify and I did a search for \"Eagle Rock Rec\" (I was too lazy to spell out \"Eagle Rock Recreation Center\" which turned out to be about 175 miles away) and the unit chugged away for several minutes but eventually came back with the right entry for me to navigate to.  I later realized that even though I didn't know the exact city the destination was in, I did know a city that was near the desired destination.  When I specified that information, the c340 took only a few seconds to find the right location.\n",
      "\n",
      "The advanced user can also create your own POI lists complete with custom icons and load those into the c340.  I have done this for all In-N-Out Burger and Krispy Kreme locations.  The advantage to having your own custom POIs even though these places are in the built-in POI list is that the custom POIs are visible on the c340 map screen at certain zoom levels.  If you are a Geocacher, you can do the same with geocaches, but you'll still need your handheld unit to find the cache.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newer (and more expensive) c5xx units evidently have the Sirf circuitry in them which is more sensitive, allowing signal acquisition indoors, but I found the sensitivity of the c340 to be fine - especially since I have limited my indoor driving lately :-). I haven't tried the c340 under a thick tree canopy with cloud cover yet, so I might change my tune.  The comparable c5xx unit at this price point, the c530, lacks the c340's text-to-speech capabilities (this prevents the c530 from announcing street names).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I already have a Garmin handheld GPS unit as well as Garmin's MapSource Topo mapping software, I used the unlock code that came with the c340 to unlock my MapSource maps for the unit. I then loaded the topo maps for the entire Western US onto an SD card (between 300-500 MB) and plugged it into the c340 to see what would happen.  It worked!  So now I have the c340's excellent built-in maps and POIs for on-road trips *and* Topo Maps available to me for off-road adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing you should do if you are in the US is enable the unit's WAAS capability (the default is for WAAS to be disabled).  Enabling this capability increases the accuracy of the unit when certain satellites are in range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, since this unit has a touch-screen, fingerprints on the screen are inevitable. You should *never* use an ammonia-based product (like most window cleaners) to clean electronic screens - it will cause them to fog.  Instead, use those little antiseptic alcohol towelettes.  They are cheap and if you don't use them for cleaning your touch-screen they might come in handy for first-aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "I give this unit a highly positive rating.  I like it\n",

      "There's no need to take anybody else's word for specs on this Sony DVD player when you can view or download, for free, the user's manual at http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-documents.pl?mdl=DVPNS90V&LOC=3. I've been running this Sony DVP-NS90V player through a Sony widescreen HDTV and a Pioneer amplifier/receiver for several days now, and I find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers. One, for example, states that there is \"no bass management,\" yet you can (a) route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting \"small\" or \"large\" for the front speaker size (see page 76 of the user's manual), and also (b) increase or decrease the bass from -15 dB to +5 dB (see page 77 of the manual). Whether you prefer analog to digital audio, or you think SACD's are tops, is a matter of opinion, taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit. I, for one, prefer DVD-Audio, and I mention this for an important reason: Some product ads and the user's manual clearly warn that this unit \"will NOT play DVD-Audio discs.\" Happy surprize: it most certainly will! For my DVD-A's that have optional Dolby 5.1 and/or DTS tracks, the player simply ignores the primary DVD-A format (normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors) but still plays the Dolby or the DTS via the digital audio (optical or coaxial) connectors. For \"pure\" DVD-A's (without Dolby 5.1 or DTS tracks), it conveniently outputs the audio BOTH via the 6 analog AND the digital connectors. And in all cases above, the audio is full multi-channel surround, and not downmixed to 2-channel PCM, nor Prologic pseudo-surround. The only DVD-A function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on DVD-A's, and so displays only the \"jacket image\" onscreen. The Quick Setup allows any DVD newbie to be up and running in a short time. And the Custom Setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and trouble-shooters that it's bound to please even the high-end audio-video geek-freaks.

If you let it sit for a day or two it's almost guaranteed that one or more of the jets will clog up and you'll get streaks in the output. Then you have to either press the front-panel control or, in more extreme cases, run the head-unclogging utility (on Linux I use mtink) to force the printer to 'blow out' the plugged jets. When the printer does this it blasts ink through the heads wasting even more of the pricey ink. Do this enough and the reservoir the printer blasts the ink into (a sponge-sandpaper-like thing) will overflow and cause the head to smear ink all over the paper. That's when you get out the Windex and paper towels and clean up the mess (google the web for details.) Because of this 'trait' I would not recommend this printer for casual users.\n",

      "Having owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far, I can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results. The drivers at least for Mac OS X are easy to understand and reliable. The ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing, is a vey nice touch as well. However, it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me. By using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings, one can get nice rich colors that are on cue. Thus this printer makes good for doing proofs. As an artist and Graphic Designer, having this quality is a blessing since this print cost $ 400 at the time of parchase. Compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from $2000 on up. Also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers. The only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer. Also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey. But what inkjet dosen't have that problem? Anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often. So any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it, the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job. So I'm giving 5 stars on the Epson 128\n",

      "Earlier this week I received the factory referbished Samsung HD841.  I have had a few days to use it and compare it to my other players, mainly my Philips 642, which have been excellent players for me. This Model does well.  I don't understand why this model has such a rough reveiw.  Note, this model has the DVI output, If your TV has an HDMI port, you will want to check out the Samsung HD 850 (identical otherwise).  First, this model has component, composite and S-video hook ups, as well as the DVI port (still have to run seperate sound out with DVI). Also, this model does feature digital coax sound out and optical sound out as well for systems that can handle 5.1 THX.  Many upconvert models do not have the digital outs on lower priced models. The picture quality is great, at 480p comparable with my Philips.  Again, The upconvert works well out the DVI hook up to my TV, but to be honest, it is hard to tell any difference between it and a good 480p progressive scan player, at least on my tv which is a 23\" 720p LCD.  Menus also are a bit difficult to figure out at first as well.  The user manual is less than impressive at explaining thing, in fact, it does not have an index.  But, it the main thing is that the player is does perform well, and is a name brand product from samsung (I have had some offbrand experience and have had perfomace problems).  THis player also appears to have DivX available on it, not noted in the product discription, so that was a suprise as well.  This will allow the use of MP4 movie files.  The remote again is bigger and at first more difficult than my other players, but after a day or so it actually is better because many of the features are available to change at the push of a button instread of going through the menus.  In all, I will continue to explore this new player, but in all it seems to be a quality product that has received some bad flack.  So give it a chane, the prices are good currently, quality has been good, and it is a Samsung.\n",
      "Note to the technosavy: I have not had luck using the component upconvert code that is available on other web sites, so I am using my DVI input for upconvert.  Also, the new Blue ray (HD 1080p) DVD players are out, so if you have the expensive hi res tvs that can handle this, you might want to wait and save till you can get the new DVD players.  \n",

      "BREAKING NEWS: If you are buying a new video playback capable iPod, please look for the new iPod Universal dock, which has s-Video output for both photos and video.  It is also ready to accept a control remote so you can control your iPod from your sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this expensive?  The answer is probably yes.  This dock was included on the original iPod Photo of late 2004 (priced $500-$600), the dock was removed as Apple lowered the prices this year to their current levels for color iPods.  However, for a couple of uses: high quality home audio and Slide Shows on hi-res TVs, it is a great alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "This dock basically serves three purposes:\n",
      "- The traditional synch & charge function available since the early days.\n",
      "- It helps you get \"Line\" output out of an iPod.  Line output is a cleaner, higher quality sound output than the usual headphone output out of the miniplug jack.  It is the best way to connect your iPod to a home stereo or home theater.\n",
      "- The super Video out for color iPods.  This function is something you cannot get without the dock.  So, if you like to show your pictures to your friends & family using a hi-res TV (Plasma, LCD or a Flat Screen) this is a great tool to use.  As an alternative, if you do not want to use s-Video and are OK with regular digital video out, a cheaper alternative is the \"Apple iPod AV Cable\" at $19 from the Apple Store or similar alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, buy this if you hook your iPod to high quality audio equipment or if you regularly do hi-res slide shows on your TV.  If you don't do it, it's just too expensive as a synch/charger, since anything you need is in the iPod box\n",

      "It can schedule upto 16 programs. It does not support VCR+ or a TViO-style program guides. You can enter a title into each schedule that appears both on the schedule list and direct navigator chapter menus. It even sorts the main schedule listing and indicates which events are on the current disk. Every on-screen menu shows you which remote control buttons are functional on that screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The commercial skip button advances about 60 seconds which isn't quite granular enough, but 2 clicks and a little fast forwarding works well. The remote operations have a very fast feeling response compared to tape players. \n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint: The remote sensor on the recorder seems to be all the way on right-hand side. When the unit is in our video cabinet, the sensor is in a deadzone for half the room. We can't shift the position much because the disk tray slot is all the way on the left side and won't open if it's too close to the wall. Of course this probably means nothing to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the highest quality setting (XP) it made a very good (near perfect I'd say) copy from a 8mm video camera using analog inputs. At that setting, only one hour of content fits on a DVD. The next lower setting (SP) which can hold two hours per disk, the copy from the video camera had some contrast problems. Most TV shows recorded in EP (8 hrs) are acceptable quality although you do see the blockiness and some motion blur at times. This is especially pronounced on animated shows. The four-hour LP setting had no apparent digital artifacts on recorded TV. It also has a Flex-mode option I haven't tried yet in which you tell it how long to record and it will fit the recording to the freespace available on the disk at the highest possible quality.  Probably would be good for recording a TV movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's too bad other vendors haven't adopted the -RAM format because most of the features on this box only work on that kind of media, but it won't play on most other equipment. The other formats seem lame by comparison, but this unit can play and record on them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Watching one show while another is recording (or the same show that's recording, but from the beginning) is very easy to do. Most of the operations are very sensible and explained on-screen pretty well, but you should spend some time in the manual if you've never had a dvd recorder before. It can do a lot of stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "One interesting feature is that no matter what input you are using, the signal is sent through the s-video output.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can't burn music CD's which seems like it would have been a trivially easy feature to add. That and a battery backup (so I won't lose my schedule) and wider angle of view for the remote sensor would required get the fifth review star\n",

Same goes for music quality, if you are listening to an mp3 that is below 128kbps the poor sound quality is because of the shoddy encoding, not the speakers.

Lastly for those of you who like to play your music and bass full blast, don't bother spending the money.  These speakers should only be purchased by people who actually care about sound quality.

      "The holder is everything you would expect and it did work a little better than I expected. It's very easy to just place the iPod in the holder and very easy to take it off. You can do it with one hand. You just pull back the small tab of the suction thing on the back and your iPod is easily removed and ready to go. The additional cup adapters is an added bonus for those who need them, but the standard one was enough for me.\n",

In fact when I was trying to figure out what the adapters were for (before reading the manual..oops), I scratched it quite a LOT trying to fit the two additional cups together. That doesn't affect functionality so it doesn't make me give it less than 5 stars. A small issue you might want to consider as well is that the TuneDok doesn't hold iPods in their cases. So if you're like me and carry your iPod everywhere in a case you might wan to consider having a case that is easy to put on the iPod and remove it to avoid the hassle everytime you want to place the iPod on the TuneDok.\n",

      "I like how the black TuneDok looks with my white iPod. It kind of makes the iPod stand out more than the TuneDok itself. I think the $15 price is pretty reasonable for the white TuneDok, and this one is too if you're willing to pay the extra $5 for it to go with your U2 iPod. But as I said, I think my white iPod looks cooler in my black car with the black TuneDok anyway.\n",

      "I've used the iTrip by Belkin, the TunecastII by Belkin, and this Monster iCarPlay for getting my tunes to my car speakers.  This is the best design and works the best of the three.  I like that it can charge my iPod and that the transmitter itself is inline.  The signal seems to be decent enough, though of course it crackles sometimes or you hear a bit of static.  This gets more pronounced the louder you make it.\n",

      "I think this is the safest for car use.  The iTrip is a nightmare because you have to change the station through the iPod.  So if you're taking a car trip (I live in NY but went to college in MI -- that's a 12 hour drive) and signals are coming in and out and you need to adjust, you really can't do it safely with the iTrip.  The Tunecast is a bit better, but that runs on batteries (the optional charger/power supply that I got for it didn't work).  Also, you can tune into any FM station with the up/down buttons, which is good, but you really only need the lower stations.  The iCarPlay has 8 frequencies it can transmit over and only 1 button.  Though I feel limited by the 8, I don't think going higher would help because there's more congestion.  I like the single button because there's no confusion whether you're going up or down and you can press the button, then easily tune the radio up a notch.  The other limitation I see is its iPod specific (uses dock connector) whereas the Tunecast just hooks into the headphone jack and it only works in cigarette lighters so you can't use it without a car (or something else with that power source).  But considering I bought it to use in my car, it does what it should and does a decent job of it\n",

With dvd viewing, the movie Dinosaur, Bug's Life, Toy Story 1 and 2, and Vegas Vacation, the colors were very vibrant, details were dynamic, and the picture quality was very accurate in at least 480 lines of resolution.

      "*I almost laughed out loud after recently reading some of the passionate and disgruntled reviews concerning the lack of key-symbol illumination. It is obvious that these reviewers did not know much about the product they purchased. Unfortunately failing to be informed about a product one buys totally demerits any kind of negative opinion resulting from that lack of knowledge. I would guess that 90% of the negative reviews about this board capitalize on this point resulting in a much lower overall rating than deserved. \n",

      "Last and probably least comes the aesthetics, of course the most subjective part of any review. I found this setup to be very sharp looking. In the dark, the vivid key definition from the backlights allows any experienced typist to quickly find whatever he/she is looking for. This eliminates the need for symbol illumination. Although symbol illumination might be a nice touch, especially for the keyboard deficient, I feel that Saitek sacrificed this option to provide very durable lettering. I have lost some lettering on Logitech keyboards sooner than the 6 months I've been using this one(Although frequency of gaming has fluctuated). Saitek Engineers probably figured that most gamers would know the keyboard well enough to not need both key definition and symbol illumination, apparently an oversight on their part. \n",

Note that the remote was not the deciding criteria, but it was a consideration. I have no real complaints about this TV, the menu system is nice and the picture very good. I do not normally use the built-in speakers so really can't comment about their sound. This TV has a 16:9 enhanced mode that must be selected from the menus, I tried it once using a DVD as source input and liked the widescreen format that the DVD player provides better than the 16:9 mode. The 27\" Sony that I have has an auto-volume feature, this 36\" does not and I do miss it. I would purchase this unit again.

      "I've gone through a ton of headphones in recent years. They've included Koss \"The Plug,\" Sennheiser PX100, Koss UR29, Koss SportaPro and a few others. All had their strong and weak points. So far, this has been the closest I've had to a good balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my tastes (not necessarily anybody else's), strong bass is one of the most important things. The PX100 felt very weak in this area, despite what everybody else seemed to say -- weaker than my old Sony MDR-NC20 (which are still going strong after 6 years and remain my backup headphone of choice thanks to their decent sound and folding ability). I had problems keeping \"The Plug\" sealed in my ears, despite the \"hold the outer ear while the Plug seats\" advice. They're also a very a bad choice for iPods because their very low impedance overdrives the amplifier circuit. The SportaPros had great bass, but leaked way too much sound. The UR29 had good bass and very good isolation, but were a little uncomfortable, warm, heavy and too bulky to use on the go. Going back a few years, I had a pair of AKG K240s that had disappointing bass. Ditto for a pair of Sennheiser HD-420s.\n",
      "\n",
      "The K26P seems to combine the better aspects of all these phones. The bass is among the strongest. When I listen to the 1812 Overture, the \"cannon blasts\" come through loud and clear, even at moderately low volumes, with no distortion at all. Isolation isn't as good as the UR29, but not too bad. Certainly a lot more portable, easy to stow in my bag at all times. The PX100s fold smaller, but they're a pain in the neck to stow in their hard case. The higher efficiency of the K26P means I can set my iPod at a lower volume. Instead of 55-60% of max volume with the UR29 or the stock earbuds, I now run at 35-40% comfortably. In terms of comfort, they're comfortable enough for hours of wearing, after a couple of slight modifications. If they press too hard on your hears, first extend the headband all the way, then GENTLY straighten each half a little bit by gripping a couple of inches of steel band at a time and unbending it. After a few tries, it should be perfectly fitted to your head. Don't bend too hard or grip the plastic parts or you can break the phones. Be patient. So it takes a couple of days of trial and error, but in the end, you get good-sounding phones that are wonderfully comfortable. You'd be surprised how little pressure is needed to produce a good seal. You'll know if you've unbent too far because either the phones will slide down or you lose bass. Here's an easy test: with a finger on each side, press the earcups harder onto your ears. If the bass doesn't get stronger as you press (the way it does with all open-air headphones), that's as good a seal as you need. I hated the little, square foam pads on the plastic sliders and quickly peeled them off. All they seem to do is create two pressure points on top of the head. Other phones with similar headbands (like the Koss SportaPro/PortaPro) don't use these pads, so I don't think they're really necessary. Better to let the headband rest directly on the scalp and distribute the pressure over the entire headband, and so far my suspicions seem to have been correct. It has been far more comfortable for me without the pads, especially after more than half an hour. In fact, without the pads, I barely feel the headband at all.\n",

      "I initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the Sony SRF-M37V because of its five one-button pre-sets which make it a no-brainer to use while exercising.  However, the SRF-59, perhaps because of its analog tuning, suffers less from co-channel and adjacent channel interference on FM.  It's audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin.  With this in mind, I purchased another SRF-59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it.  I literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed I was having so much fun scanning the FM dial.  There was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bass-heavy 12\" remixes of eighties new wave hits with, blessfully, very limited commercial interruption.  Over the course of a three hour listening session, I gradually cranked up the volume.  As I was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds, it became apparent that with bass-heavy audio at very loud volumes the SRF-59's tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock Walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality (I understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output, therefore there will be no audio clipping).  Nevertheless, the sound quality from this bargain-priced Walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding.  The party is literally in your head, and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear, which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses.  I also made one pass through the AM band and there the SRF-59 was no slouch either.  I hauled in 1200 WOAI San Antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me.  Though no true DX machine, after all how could it be, it is at the least a competent performer on the AM band as well (I suspect early in the evening AM DXing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time).  For more on this model and others visit Xin Feng's website.  I highly recommend this model for cheap thrills!         \n",

      "There are lots of reviews here and most appear to be on-target relative to my experience with these headphones.  But here are my 2 cents:\n",
      "I got these to replace some aging Sony MDR-V2's that I purchased maybe 10 years ago.  The ear cushions of the MDR-V2's had begun to deteriorate, and I figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years.  I just compared them to the older V2s and I can say that the V6 is definitely better.  They fully surround the ears (V2s just sat on your ear, pressing on them).  The V6s also seem to offer more detailed sound.  I concur that they sound a little bright, but I can take care of this on my iPod by setting the EQ to ReduceTreble (but I like the brightness, so sometimes I don't do that).  I do NOT concur with other review comments about weak bass.  They appear to have the right amount.  (IMHO - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade, at the expense of flatness and non-coloring of sound).  I also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good (plenty loud for me with the iPod - and I listen at good levels - albeit not ear damaging ones).\n",

      "The Good: They are not only noise-cancelling, but they also are rubber earbuds which fit snugly and comfortably in the ear, blocking more noise. If you put them on without any audio source, in only dulls background noise, but I think that's the best you can expect from any pair. While listening to audio, nearly everything is blocked out unless you really listen for it. There is a neck strap with the noise-cancelling component in the middle and the two earbuds hanging from each side. You put it around your neck like a necklace, put the buds in your ears, and use the power and volume controls on the noise-cancelling piece.\n",

      "The Bad: Nothing is actually \"bad\" about them, but they're not quite perfect. The earbuds will easily slip out if you're sweating, or if they get at all greasy from your skin or earwax. However, they pop right off and you can wash them with a little soap and water in about 10 seconds. I do this daily when I use them. However, that doesn't make them the best solution for walking or jogging. Once one starts slipping, it generally won't stay in well until it (and your ears) have been cleaned, which detracts from the noise-cancelling effect. \n",

      "Other Thoughts: The cord is plenty long enough to reach an iPod or whatever at about belt level. However, if the player is in a pants pocket, it could be a little close. Also, I often wear it when I'm not using it, because you can forget it's there, and also it beats putting it into a pocket to get tangled. I had an issue once because I was sitting at a desk, and it dangled to the floor. When I stood up, I stood on the end and the force of my neck going up while my foot held it down damaged the wiring -- I began to get a slight buzz in one ear. However, I blame myself for that -- it was a mighty tug.\n",

Just the \"hints\" of bass in the music but no thud, if that's what you are hoping for. I did turn these up loud to listen to their full sound and they do sound good.

      "I recently bought an HP 17\" widescreen laptop and needed to find a case for traveling.

It has a pocket that it slides into if not needed- that came in handy in the airport.\n",
      "\n",
      "This case looks extremely sturdy (well built!)and dirt just seems to wipe right off of it. It holds my 17\" laptop, PDA, Cell phone, computer mouse, one-time-use cameras, Ipod, and all the wires and chargers for those electronics. I even fit two books, keys, a folder filled with directions and plane tickets, a notebook, and two dvd's in here. (all of that at the same time) Granted, all that stuff makes it pretty heavy to lug around the airport, so if you are doing that routinely you are going to want something with wheels or backpack form. The strap on this bag is extremely sturdy and cushiony. The strap was long enough for me to wear it diagonally accross my chest if I wanted, but it is not detachable (which means it isn't likely to fall off easily).\n",
      "\n",
      "This bag is extremely well-designed. There is a strap for attaching it to wheeled luggage...it even fits under the window seat of the airplane and those areas for storage are much smaller than the aisle seats. Very well padded..I knocked my brand new computer around a bit during the travels and kept opening the case to make sure it was okay! Of course it was fine because there are 3 heavy duty layers of padding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because this bag does all that and more, it is large. It becomes larger the more you stuff it (obviously). However, I am 5'1\" and I carried it fine from North Carolina to New York.

Also, in the stores I checked this was sold for about 30 dollars more than here on amazon!! If you have a smaller laptop, this case will work just fine too! It has an adjustable divider. You will just gain more room for other stuff. I look foward to long usage of this case.\n",

      "I've read the other reviews of this product and feel a need to defend this gadget. I've owned mine for about three years and I love it. I use it nightly. The application I find this perfect for is Audio Books stored on MP3. This of one of the only small, portable MP3 players that has it's own speakers. I go to bed listening to audio books and I don't want to wear a pair of earphones or lug a set of extra powered speakers around. However just slightly larger than a CD Walkman when folded closed it is small enough to work great on an airline trip, where headphones are preferable to the endless roar of the planes engines.\n",

      " 3) Short Battery life.\n",

      "2) I'll agree with the poor bass reproduction in the speakers. Small cone's yield small bass. It's a physics thing. However when I travel and use this to play music in a hotel room, it's been good enough to satisfy the want of a little background music.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Battery Life. I'm surprised by the times listed by other reviewers. I get about 30-35 hours of use when I'm on the road using the AA's. When at home or in a hotel, the AC adapter removes the concern about battery life completely. \n",

The contrast ratio is higher than most other flat-panels I looked at, which have a contrast ratio of around 500:1 to 700:1 (including Samsung's own 20.1\" non-widescreen model).

Plus, the monitor has DVI, analog VGA, S-Video, and RCA inputs (which would allow you to plug in a DVD player if you want).  The monitor can also rotate 90 degrees, and it has built-in speakers and a headphone jack.\n",

      "The KOSS Pro-4AA's were not made for iPod/MP3 headphone users.  TO begin with, they reveal the low fidelity of MP3 files (compared with LP's or CD's).  Also, they require a 1/4\"-to-3.5mm (or other) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment.\n",

      "These Headphones have been around a long time. Check out the old photos of the \"Watergate\" hearings from 1973/1974, and notice that the Senators & attorneys were all listening through KOSS Pro 4AA headphones.  Their longevity is mainly due to their extermely high fidelity audio reproduction. Unfortunately, their age has made them somewhat inconvenient for most listeners, since they are very heavy and a bit cumbersome.\n",

      "3) The coiled cord is extremely difficult to replace (it's actually less expensive to replace the entire set of headphones of you can get a good discount).\n",
      "\n",
      "POSITIVES:\n",
      "1) AUDIO FIDELITY. Unless you want to spend at least $300 for a set of headphones, the sound quality and fidelity of the Pro-4AA's is almost impossible to beat.\n",
      "2) VALUE. As noted above, for the price you pay, these are vastly superior to any other headphones that are comparably priced.\n",
      "3) DURABLE. My first pair lasted 30 years.  They were dropped and knocked around, and finally gave out when (It think) a voltage spike surged in the left earphone, fusing a coil.\n",
      "4) ISOLATION. THe paddded earphones block out external sound very well.\n",

      "The biggest Positive (and the reason why I prefer to use Pro-4AA's for audio mixing, other studio applications, and serious listeining) is that they are extremely unlikely to be stolen.  Size matters: they are heavy, and bulky so they're not easily concealed; and since iPOD or MP3 players use the mini plugs, these require additional hardware.

I have had no problems hearing anyone, nor has anyone had difficulty hearing me.  The earpiece is comfortable and easy to get on and off, even for someone with elfishly small ears like me! \n",

Even with completely flat EQ setting, the headset does very good job with sound (provided you increase the volume up a bit more).

      "\n",
      "- Ear padding is perhaps, too soft. This means it won't fully cover your ear area, and some of sound may leak out. So note that when you listen to your music loud in public places. Although, at first few weeks, the ear padding is relatively hard. If you are looking for a headphone that will ensure your music will never leak out, look into getting in-ear canal type headphones instead.\n",

      "2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n",
      "3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n",
      "4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n",
      "5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n",
      "6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n",

While some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations, in a disaster, you only need a few stations, as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news.  Between the AM, FM, TV, and NOAA bands, my radio will received a huge number of stations--many more than would ever be needed in a disaster.  (I didn't try the cellphone charging function.)  It comes in a carrying case.\n",
      "Only minor criticisms:  The case seems like an afterthought:  it doesn't hold the AC adapter; the knobs tend to turn the radio on when putting it in the case, and the knobs could get broken off if the case is hit (not that protective). However, it comes in a strong box which is perhaps better storage for everything.\n",
      "Overall, this is all you should need for light, siren, and broadcast information from multiple power sources in a disaster\n",

I used Motorola Phone Tools to transfer my entire music library.  The program converts the mp3 file formats before transfer. The entire music library...a full 1GB...transferred reasonably quickly.  The V3m is slow to access \"My Music\" using menu function #3 under \"Get Tunes & Tones\".  Function #6 \"Manage Music\" accesses the library reasonably quickly and works well.  The new corded Motorola SYN1301B stereo earbuds work well in this configuration.  Sound quality is surprisingly good, but the large diameter earbuds are flat...not tapered... and do not seat very well in the ear canal.

Once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable WEP and put in the key and passphrase, I had to turn WEP back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender.

      "4-make sure that the default gateway and subnet mask settings are identical with your Router or AP,change password on the expander if desired & save settings. (all settings should be correct due to auto configuration) \n",
      "5-Enable WEP on the expander, once again remember use same settings that you will be putting in your router or AP in step 6 -- aka same passphrase), save settings again. \n",
      "5.5 - As soon as you enable WEP on your expander - you will loose your connection to it as it's now setup for WEP and your router isn't - keep this in mind - drove me nuts. \n",

      "I have had this TV since Mid-March 2006. I absolutley love it!! I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect, especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing \"Bourne Supremecy\" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy.\n",

When I decided to buy their was no longer free shipping, so off to Best Buy I went where they price matched me with amazon's price no questions asked. Best Buy offers an extended warranty for around $400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems. It will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it.

      "I bought a pair of Sony MDR-XD100's (they are full cup headphones) because I lost the earbuds which came with my mp3 player (Sony HD5). I took them out of the package and found that, even at full volume on the player, it cannot drive the headphones sufficently. I went to a few electronics stores then found the KOSS EQ50.\n",
      "\n",
      "On with the review:\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there is a slight hiss, but I find it alright. The biggest gripe I have is that whenever someone within about 2-3 ft (IE, on a bus or subway) uses a cellphone, this devices picks it up. You can get the same effect by using a cellphone next to an unshielded pair or speakers. I do most of my listening at home so this won't bo too much of an issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also does a great job of amplifying the signal, it works very well, I can now listen to my XD100's properly (and they are very good!). I haven't used the EQ much but what I can say is that it is very, very sensitive. Raising the bass slider a third above normal makes a massive difference. At a half, my headphones start to distort.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your looking for a nice little EQ and/or preamp this is the product for you. It has its drawbacks though, mainly the problem with cellphone interference and of course, the hiss but it isn't too loud & I can live with it.\n",

      "It is remarkable that, even though there are hundreds of iPod cases in existence, none of them are near-perfect.  I tried four different cases, both hard plastic and silicone variants, and the iskin case comes the closest, protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case is basically a hybrid of hard plastic and soft silicone.  The ipod first slips into a silicone sleeve, which covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen.  In addition, there is a hard plastic plate that is then inserted into seems on the front of the silicone case, and this provides the screen protection.  Due to the double-seam in the silicone, the plastic plate never comes in contact with the ipod, so you don't have to worry about it scratching.\n",

      "The case even has a flap that covers the dock connector, preventing dust from entering, yet you can still use the universal dock without removing the case.\n",

      "The only real downside I found with the iskin is the clip that comes with it--I would not trust it at all, so I took it off.  It would be nice to have a better clip that you can actually use, and it would be really great to have an armband available for it as well, but as I said above, I have yet to find a perfect ipod case.  Like most silicone cases, this one does also attract lint in your pockets, etc., but it is not as bad as other cases.\n",

I ordered from Applelinks, and they delivered it to me in four days.  Whatever you do, don't order from the iSkin company directly.

      "I tried both Microsoft's LifeCam VX-3000 and VX-6000. Had 'em both home and ran trials with my Intel Pentium D Dual Core 3.00GHz CPU with 2 gigs of ram and, with both of those, the video lagged the audio (distractingly so). Spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly Microsoft customer service rep one evening (got through on their toll free line)and he pointed me to new software for the VX-6000. Downloaded the 50 meg plus file, installed it, but the VX-6000 still produced out-of-sync video vs. audio when I created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on Media Player or editing in Windows Movie Maker. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, I talked to some technicians at our company and then talked to the webcam guru at the local assembler that built my, I believe, excellent computer. All recommended Logitech when buying webcams. I then marched back to Best Buy and traded my $99 Microsoft VX-6000 for a Logitech Quickcam Orbit MP for BB's price of $139.95. You can find this Logitech unit cheaper all over the place, including, of course, here at Amazon. The package I bought included an inexpensive headset, which I haven't used so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I haven't tried the Orbit in a video phone call yet, from the moment I turned it on I had that satisfing good feeling that I bought a winner. Installed fairly easily with a couple of bumps. Got a \"USB composite device has not passed Windows Logo testing\" screen a couple of times..BUT..I received the SAME screen on, get this, the Microsoft cams! I just continued installing and have not experienced system problems so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audio sync with video in making a recording is right on (remember, that was primary reason for taking back the Microsoft cameras) AND the picture clarity on my LCD flat panel monitor at the 640 webcam capture setting produced a gorgeous picture. Excellent detail and smoothness of video. Besides the superior audio sync with video, the Orbit MP is remarkably better than the VX-6000 and way above the $49 Microsoft VX-3000 in all other criteria too, in my opinion after comparison testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Orbit's special effects are interesting and fun. The pan, tilt, etc., excellent. The face tracking is vigorous and alive - fun to watch the little Orbit camera turn - but I haven't tested in actual live conferencing yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all - for webcams, I'm now saying what more experienced webcam users told me - head for Logitech. They've certianly hooked me with their apparent superior performance. The Orbit MP is a keeper! Not going to waste anymore time searching and testing. And, my advice to Microsoft, you'd better talk to the outfit that bought your name for those Lifecams. I've relied on the Microsoft name on peripherals, keyboards, etc., and I've generally been very satisfied. But, in webcams, with me, the Microsoft brand now takes a back seat to Logitech.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm very pleased with my little iQue M5 GPS/PDA.  While it's not perfect, it's pretty darn amazing. I had actually purchased a Lowrence iWay 350 GPS, but then my husband discovered the iQue on sale at Costco for about [...] more.  With the iQue offering so many more features, I returned the Lowrence and purchased the iQue.  With my husband and I both having the same machines, we can beam information to each other or send them over Bluetooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has taken many hours of playing around with it to get to learn the device, as it isn't very intuitive and the manuals, especially for the PDA, are limited. My husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the GPS, and he's learning its idiosyncrasies as far as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas.  It's very sophisticated and the maps are great - better detail than the Lowrence.  We purchased a 2 Gig memory card and downloaded the entire map database onto it, and there were still 300 gigs to spare.  I had no trouble downloading the maps or the Active Sync software.  The basic GPS functions are easy to use once you get the hang of it, the voice directions are clear and concise, and it re-routes quickly if you go off course.  You can plan your route in advance without having the GPS activated.  This is a good idea, since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites, and you can be on your way if you've viewed your route before starting out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used the GPS on a trip Stratford, Canada, and it was wonderful having the Canadian maps as well as the US maps available. I even used it handheld while walking to my bed-and-breakfast from the theater.  Every once in awhile there is a glitch (it said the theater was on the left, which would have taken me into the Avon River!), but it's generally right on target and I find most of the problems are operator error, such as turning too soon. The \"Route to Home\" feature is very convenient. Granted, the iQue doesn't always take you on the shortest route, but it will get you where you're going and if you're \"directionally challenged\" like I am, it becomes indispensible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The car mounting bracket works fine.  It's popped off occasionally in hot weather, but generally stays put. The bracket would be easy to move to another vehicle.  The GPS would work in a cup-holder if you needed to use it in a rental car.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've spent more time learning the PDA portion, which uses Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition. The iQue uses Outlook as its interface, so you'll have to have it installed on your computer. Not having used Outlook before, I installed Outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting familiar with it, which was helpful.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The PDA has so many functions that it's hard to even describe what this little machine can do.  It will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts, checks e-mail, accesses the Internet if you get a Wi-Fi card, recognizes handwriting, has a voice recorder, interfaces with other Bluetooth units, sends alarms, has Word and Excel, even has a couple of good games.  I got a separate SD card for music and downloaded a lot of songs, and the sound through headphones is quite acceptable (it has bass boost).  It uses Windows Media Player so you can organize all of your playlists.  You can download any programs that are available for Windows Mobile 2003, including TV shows and videos.  I never thought I'd find much use for a PDA but I'm using it every day.  No more little notes on scraps of paper or a separate pocket calendar, address book or even an IPod.  Everything is in one handy-dandy little machine. And even though it isn't that intuitive, once you've learned the basic conventions they translate to most of the programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've called Garmin Tech Support a few times and, although they are only open during regular business hours, we found American staff who are very knowledgeable about the product.  Since a good GPS will run at least [...], this was a great bargain at around [...]  We've purchased screen protectors and are hoping it won't wear out too quickly, as I've heard Palm Pilots tend to do.  I'm really enjoying the iQue.\n",

      "I had been talking about wanting an MP3 player, but I did NOT want an iPod, as I heard you cannot add files in Windows format and that's what all of my music is.  I received this e260 4 GB MP3 player for my birthday in June 2006, and this is the first MP3 player I have ever owned.  Although there are a few little quirks, overall I am not disappointed and would recommend this MP3 player.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like many rechargeable battery-powered items, it required a lengthy initial charge before first use.  After that, the future charges don't seem to take as long.  The MP3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge.  Although I've never run it completely down, I have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "I installed the software on my computer, and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual.  I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual, and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it). \n",
      "\n",
      "It came pre-loaded with 20 songs, only one of which I had ever heard of (and it was one of those no-name bands that played once on Saturday Night Live).  Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices, I decided to leave them on there until I need the space.  About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months.  I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as performance goes, it performs pretty well.  The buttons are a little difficult to get used to, as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  Not too bad, but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there, you will be scrolling a lot.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player.  It has music, fm radio, photo, voice, video and a settings option.  I have used the music function and the voice recorder option, both with good results.  The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer.  It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer.  As for syncing music files, I have not had any problems, although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded, but when you try to play it, it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list.  I don't know what caused this.  Also, you can only store a song as one genre, which is a little annoying.  Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player, you cannot change the genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came with a headset, but I have never used it.  Instead I purchased some Panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I do wish the MP3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer's USB drive to charge.  Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen.  I can't remember it being dropped or anything, so I don't know what caused this, but it's pretty noticeable.  It doesn't seem to affect the operation, just the aesthetics.\n",

I will not play a PC game without it plugged in now, that's how well this gamepad has worked for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the ins and outs:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Solid construction. As others have stated, this device feels very solid and is just generally \"sturdy as hell\". This, alone, surprised me. Not too many electronic devices are solidly made these days (not too many at all!)... so I'm glad to see that this one was. Belkin did an excellent job in this department.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Software. Do yourself a favor, when you get this device home, don't bother putting in the CD that comes with it. Instead, go directly to Belkin's website first-thing, download the newer version of the software (which is near exactly the same as what's on the CD, but updated) and install that *before* plugging in your speedpad for the first time. Do that and you'll have everything updated immediately with little to no trouble at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had no problems with the software for this hardware (and that's generally the part I have trouble with the most). The applications (profiler and button editor) function perfectly, and macros are a snap to program. Kudos to Belkin's programmers on writing the software suite for this, they did a good job.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Sticky keys. Most people have experienced this.. myself included. Being possibly a byproduct of the solid construction of the product, basically, what happens is the keys stick just a little bit coming out of the box. Though just \"excercising\" the device (pressing the buttons down quickly and solidly over and over) for a few seconds after plugging it in each time I went to use it cleared up this issue within the first week of using the gamepad, and I've never had it happen since. \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Other buttons. \n",
      "* The mouse scroll wheel can be an annoyance, and I don't use it much at all because it's hard to scroll up and down with it (Belkin may just have made that particular button a little *too* solid). \n",
      "* The orange button above the d-pad also isn't that easy to press, though if you keep you pinky finger positioned on the side of the keypad for leverage, it's not impossible to press this button (in fact, I use it as my default \"map\" button in most of the games I play). It's perfect for those functions you use enough to need a button for but not enough to need an easy spam button.\n",
      "* I haven't experienced any problems hitting the 'space' button below the d-pad that others have experienced. My thumb taps that button as easily as it taps the space bar on a standard keyboard. My only complaint with it is that I can't simply twist my thumb a bit to hit the key, I have to actually lift my thumb off the d-pad to do it - and that's not much of a complaint at all, really.\n",
      "\n",
      "The d-pad itself is a godsend! I'm a true console gamer, having used nothing but d-pads for movement since all the time spent playing my old NES as a kid (and using a joystick before that with my even older Atari). D-pad is all I know, really. In fact, the one thing that's kept me away from PC gaming all these years is I've never, ever been able to accustom myself to using arrow keys or WASD for movement (and probably never will get accustomed to that either). For the longest time I was looking for a device that could allow me to keep the sensitivity of mouse aiming (to keep up with other PC players) while giving me an actual d-pad for movement... and that is EXACTLY what this gamepad did for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I said at the top of this review, I will never play a PC game without my Nostromo speedpad plugged in. This gamepad has provided the one benefit that other pads haven't and that I really needed - a controller interface that's actually functional and intuitive enough to use that I forget I'm using it most of the time, allowing me to immerse myself completely in whatever game I'm playing... which is really the point of gaming in the first place, isn't it? \n",
      "\n",
      "The Nostromo Speedpad gets 5 stars from me. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for the type of benefits I've listed. And, for that matter, I'm recommending it right now in fact...\n",

Once you're done, however, it's very easy to use and carry.  It comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use.  The case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket, unlike so many other cases.  The obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface, this case won't provide much in a way of side protection (klutzes be warned).

The extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who don't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward, backward, and switch between programs. The button in the middle though (the one that lets you switch programs) is out of the way. It takes just a bit more effort to use, meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button. I actually hardly ever use that button. I can't live without the forward/backward buttons though. I find myself man-handling other mice thinking they too have those neat, little buttons. The mouse has a really good response to movement as well. I've used it for gaming as well, though I admit I'm not a hardcore gamer. I really recommend this mouse.

I'll admit \"NROUTE\" took a little getting used to (for example it has a list of all the streets and names of places so if it isnt on the list you're not going to find it) but once you figure out how it works its easy as pie.  Instead of spelling Hoover Street you just type Hoover and it will give you a list of the possible locations.  A great buy for only 100 bucks!
